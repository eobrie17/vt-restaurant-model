Cole and michelle make us feel like Family. we laugh and laugh and it feels great. BTW, the lobster risotto with a touch of tarragon was incredible. It was so enjoyable Julie ordered another risotto to go! The vibe in the Farmhouse is intimate and upbeat at the same time. We love it there. Five stars. <br&gt;<br&gt;Joe P",2/16/2023,5

2,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Nice restaurant in Vermont that serves food sourced locally. After attending a wedding, a group of friends and I came here for brunch. It was very enjoyable for all of us. The house bennies come highly recommended from me!<br&gt;<br&gt;My recommendation is to make a reservation in advance at this restaurant because it is really busy.",1/26/2023,5
3,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Another great meal at The Farmhouse Tap and Grill. For the second time we came in right before hopping on a flight home. <br&gt;<br&gt;Husband had a burger. He said the burger itself was ok, but the accoutrements were very good. My son was dying for some soup and enjoyed his first ever bowl of cheddar soup! I wasn&amp;#39;t very hungry so opted for the Mac and cheese. It was good, but needed to be more seasoned.<br&gt;<br&gt;Service was great. The restaurant itself is very nice and well decorated. <br&gt;<br&gt;Hoping to stop in again when in the area and be able to have a nice leisurely meal!",3/3/2023,4
4,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"My husband and I had a short period of time last weekend to grab some dinner before heading to the airport. When we arrived the wait was about 30-45min but there were some seats at the bar so we quickly grabbed two seats.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our lovely bar tender took our drink order. I asked for lemonade but that wasn&amp;#39;t an option so the bartender gave me a taste of a maple soda of sorts. Wish I could remember the name, it was so good I ordered one. Husband had some crazy on top beer that was quite tart but good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Husband ordered the LaPlatte River Angus burger and I had the fish and chips. When we told our bartender we were short on time and had to catch a flight she got our food out quickly and it was nice and hot!  She was also attentive and engaged us in conversation which was nice. She made the meal and took this review from a 4 to 5 star!",10/22/2022,5
5,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Had dinner at The Farmhouse Tap &amp;amp; Grill on Friday night. It was a fine option and I appreciated that they were open late, but nothing on the menu would bring me back.<br&gt;<br&gt;Quality: We arrived late to town and were among the last folks seated. They have an extensive craft beer selection, which was one of the biggest draws. However, I was not really crazy about any of the food. The Cheddar Ale Soup was bland and needed more than just three croutons. The Crispy Onion Rings were okay for a side, the horseradish aioli was a nice touch. Adams&amp;#39; Farm Chicken &amp;amp; Biscuits was a fairly mediocre dish. The biscuits were a bit dry and despite looking beautiful, the chicken was overdone. <br&gt;Quantity: Decent sized dishes.<br&gt;Value: $8 for the Cheddar Ale Soup. $8 for the Crispy Onion Rings. $28 for the Adams&amp;#39; Farm Chicken &amp;amp; Biscuits.<br&gt;Ambiance: The Farmhouse Tap &amp;amp; Grill is located along the main stretch in Burlington. It is a very large restaurant, with a huge outdoor patio and an even bigger indoor area. It was a beautiful night so no heaters needed, but they seemed prepared for the cold to arrive any minute. The music inside was recent pop songs played at full blast, which led to everyone inside raising the volume even more.<br&gt;Crowd: As one of the few restaurants that stays open late, it was busy on Friday night.<br&gt;Service: Fast and friendly.<br&gt;Parking: Plenty of nearby parking.",11/1/2022,3
6,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Came here because of the reviews <br&gt;<br&gt;And thank goodness we did! Waitstaff was so kind, attentive and quick to get orders in and out. We felt valued and kudos to the manager for having such a great team <br&gt;<br&gt;Appetizers: <br&gt;- cheddar ale soup: super cheesy and so dang good. I didn&amp;#39;t want to share a single bite. <br&gt;<br&gt;- maple cornbread: the butter sets it over the top. Carmedized bottom and amazing consistency throughout <br&gt;<br&gt;Food: <br&gt;- husband had the fish and chips and said it was BOMB! Crispy on the outside and full of flavor. Tons of fries to eat too. <br&gt;<br&gt;- I had the blue cheese toast. The honey drizzled on top and the jam under it really put the the funkiness of the blue cheese down a little (in the best way) the flavors worked so well together. I would order again <br&gt;<br&gt;Dessert: <br&gt;- shaved ice with maple syrup: such a fun dessert to go and the cute spoons made it even better. Fun, light, fresh and cold. <br&gt;<br&gt;If we ever come back to Burlington- we will be coming back here! Thank you for an amazing experience",9/19/2022,5
7,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"GreaT place! First time in Vermont and this was our first stop. We had the onion rings (ask for extra sauce), Turkey burger, regular burger, and side salad. Very delicious and salad was AMAZING",3/2/2023,5
8,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Do yourself a favor and go try this place, you will not be disappointed. We were in the area and looking for somewhere good to eat. This place was highly rated so figured it must be good and we&amp;#39;d give it a try. Excellent food!!! We got here around 10:45am we had the brunch and lunch menu and decided to both order brunch I got the eggs Benedict, amazing I have never had kale with this dish and it was really good. The salad that it came with so good, I absolutely loved the dressing and I ended up eating the rest of my husbands salad he didn&amp;#39;t finish. The homemade Hash brown cakes perfectly crispy on the outside and like mashed potatoes on the inside. My husband got the breakfast plate and loved it he said the eggs were probably too be best eggs he&amp;#39;s ever had. We got my little one fries and a side of bacon, the fries were great and I loved their sauces! They have a great drink menu, beer, wine, cocktails, and non alcoholic which was amazing because my husband doesn&amp;#39;t drink but likes to have something besides the normal soda and he loved the sparking apple cider they have here in a can. Also can&amp;#39;t forget to mention good service as well.",2/5/2023,5
9,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,good food and awesome staff sit at the bar you will not be disappointed.

10,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,Juicy meals! The cheddar soup was the best thing I have ever eaten. Yummy like a mummy.,3/31/2023,5
11,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"I had an amazing dining experience here, and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Vermont. I would advise coming an hour or so early to put your name on the waiting list, as they don&amp;#39;t take reservations of less than seven, and the line can become rather long. <br&gt;<br&gt;When we were able to be seated, we sat in a cozy outside area, that felt tucked away from the busyness of the main restaurant room. Our server, Connor, was very friendly and helpful and was able to offer good recommendations. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the cast-seared salmon, which was absolutely wonderful, in taste and presentation in my opinion. The others members of were happy with their meals of the tamarack farm lamb burger and the adam&amp;#39;s farm chicken and biscuits. For dessert we shared their apple pie crumble with vanilla ice cream, and the strawberry shake, which unfortunately is not pictured below. <br&gt;<br&gt;Would love to come back and try more soon!",10/8/2022,5
12,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Lovely spot, great food and drink. Service was incredibly attentive. Ambiance left nothing to be desired, all around lovely spot to grab dinner at if you are in Burlington.",2/3/2023,5
13,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,I came in here on a Sunday evening. There was a bit of a wait but the bar and beer garden had open seating. There is a more limited menu for the beer garden. I opted for the pork burger that came with a sunny side up egg. The burger was delicious and the fries were great as well.,7/18/2022,4
14,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,Great food &amp;amp; great service!  Came to Vermont to visit our daughter who is a student at UVM and we had lunch at The Farmhouse and had a wonderful meal!,3/6/2023,5
15,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"We stopped in for Sunday brunch after a nearby place had a long wait, this is apparently a theme for me. There was no wait, we all got breakfast food (Veggie Benedict, Breakfast Plate, Challah French Toast), and we were all very happy with it. Looking at my previous review, I don&amp;#39;t think I quite did this place justice, hence the update. Definitely looking forward to coming back again!",2/12/2023,5
16,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"We thought we&amp;#39;d have a 90 minute wait and end up eating somewhere else, but a short walk around the block and 25 minutes later we were at our table. We didn&amp;#39;t go for any appetizers but I got a burger and tried some of the mac &amp;amp; cheese, both were great. My only complaint was the portions were pretty small. That was fine with us (stopped for ice cream in the afternoon) but it doesn&amp;#39;t quite line up with the price, and it isn&amp;#39;t too upscale either.",6/27/2021,4
17,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"I ordered the fish and chips for my main entrée and one of the zero proof cocktails for my beverage (nonalcoholic Island Crusher). The fish and chips were fantabulous with incredible taste and texture. The fish was fresh and well-seasoned, and the fries were very delicious. For my dessert, I had a sensational apple pie a la mode, which was off the chain. The ambiance was lively, and the server was very responsive.",7/12/2022,5
18,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"The food is delicious (albeit rich), but the service is quite odd and disturbing. Would order take out, due to insanely slow service.",7/25/2022,4
19,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"I will come back over and over again just for the cheddar ale soup, and dressed greens!",2/28/2023,5
20,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,Get the oysters. The pork burger with a fried egg is great as well. Good beer selections. Make reservations ahead of time. Always a great time.,2/3/2023,5
21,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Excellent location with a hip vibe all around. I only went downstairs to eat and drink, but I would highly suggest this place. Although the pot roast was delicious, the wings were even better. Excellent location for socializing.",1/27/2023,4
22,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Shortly after we arrived in Burlington, we were hungry and in search of food and glad we found The Farmhouse Tap &amp;amp; Grill. Since there was a long wait to indoor dining, we decided to sit outside. Our server Connor was attentive and paid attention to detail regarding allergies.<br&gt;<br&gt;For drinks, we recommend the Downeast Cider Original Blend and Von Trapp Helles.<br&gt;<br&gt;For appetizers, we shared an order of Crispy Onions Rings, which was served over horseradish aioli with additional condiments including ketchup, mustard, mayo, ans hot sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;The other guests in my party enjoy their dinner entrees including the Grilled Vermont Pork Loin, Roasted Dayboat Cod, and Adams Farm Chicken and Biscuits. The Grilled Vermont Pork Loin was served with fingerling potatoes, fall squash, and braised kale in a creamy mustard sauce. The Roasted Dayboat Cod was served with spaghetti squash, shaved radish, and herb salad in a lemon beurre blanc sauce. The Adams Farm Chicken and Biscuits consisted of pan roasted chicken served with mini cheddar scallion biscuits, roasted root vegetables, and roasted brussel sprouts in flavorful pan sauce. I wasn&amp;#39;t super hungry so I had a Butternut Squash Bisque, Roasted Fall Squash, and Roasted Roots. The Butternut Squash Bisque was finished with pickled apple, a pumpkin seed oil drizzle, and sumac yogurt drizzle. It was a bit thicker than I liked. The Roasted Fall Squash consisted of Does&amp;#39; Leap Farm cherve, roasted delicata squash, cider gastrique, endive, pepitas, cranberries, shaved radish, and mint. The Roasted Roots consisted of roasted carrots, parsnip, and fennel. I&amp;#39;ll admit I order-ordered and didn&amp;#39;t have any room for dessert :(",10/10/2022,4
23,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Great ambience for a date night or an early dinner with your kids.  The wings were juicy and flavorful.  The burger was also a yummy surprise!  We ordered it with the salad and it was a great refreshing compliment to the burger.  Salad with salmon on top was also perfection.  Great food, great drinks!",1/17/2023,4
24,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"From start to finish everything was amazing! Our drinks (a Mule, and Margarita) were basic yet top notch! We did ask the waitress if the ginger beer used was gluten free as my girlfriend has an allergy, she immediately checked with the bartender and came right back to let us know it was. I got cheddar scallion biscuits to start and they were amazing, they came in a small Dutch pan soaking in horse radish herb butter; I had to stop myself after 2. The remaining two were equally delicious a day or two later. For dinner we both decided to try one of the specials listed for the evening, &amp;#34;Laplatte River beef burger&amp;#34; I kept mine with blue cheese and a regular bun, my girlfriend got a gluten free bun and goat cheese, I opted for the salad, my girlfriend went with fries. Both sides were delicious, and the burgers were to die for. Before our food came out the waitress dropped off house made ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, and hot sauce; each of which was better than any other I&amp;#39;ve tried. The service was great, all employees were very friendly. The decor was very homey as well.",2/9/2023,5
25,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"WOW! An overall outstanding experience. From the employees to the decor to the drinks and the FOOD! Incredible. You will not be disappointed. We have been here twice so far and both times we felt welcomed, comfortable and of course the food was delicious and cooked to perfection.",3/22/2023,5
26,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"So fresh, great food, friendly service. Highly recommended! <br&gt;<br&gt;The lake perch taco is sweet, light, just perfect for summer.",7/1/2022,5
27,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,Great atmosphere!  Always open - which is huge when you&amp;#39;re looking for a nice lunch or dinner on a Monday!  Appreciate the work effort!  Great staff and delicious food!,3/15/2023,5
28,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,This was our third time at Farmhouse Tap &amp;amp; Grill. If just based on our first two visits I&amp;#39;d give it five stars. Tonight  the kitchen was either short handed or something else was off.  Our server did a great job but it took 30 minutes for our apps to come out - onion rings and wings - and 30 minutes after that our entrees arrived.  The food was delicious but if this had been my first experience at FTG I wouldn&amp;#39;t go back.  Hopefully on our next visit the timing will be better.,3/18/2023,3
29,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Expansive food and drink palace that won a place in my heart by serving me the best burger I&amp;#39;ve ever had, and this aging body has consumed many. <br&gt;<br&gt;Went with wife and UVM-attending daughter on a foliage season-amped Sunday night, and, without reservations, we were still quickly sipping beers on couches in the back beer garden while waiting on a table. During those 30 delicious minutes, we enjoyed the Rising Hope IPA (passion fruit, guava notes) and a platter of hand cut fries that brought out the predator in each of us. <br&gt;<br&gt;Then whisked out to the overhead heated patio, where we leaned into kale, ordering the entree-sized Kale and Arugula salad with blue cheese niblets and sprinkled with roasted quinoa that looked and crunched just like bacon, but tasted maybe better. <br&gt;<br&gt;Entrees included my preternatural Lamb Burger, medium rare and maximally perfect, the grilled smokiness playing off the tangy pickled onions and sharp feta. Swoon city. <br&gt;<br&gt;No farmhouse is perfect. Daughter&amp;#39;s New England sea food chowder was deconstructed, &amp;#34;pretentious&amp;#34; said she. Not really a chowder but shell fish on a baconey white sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Wife&amp;#39;s crispy quinoa cakes were well-textured but not memorable. <br&gt;<br&gt;But the overall experience was memorable.  5 stars, for me, means that I would make a real effort to return. And I will.",10/4/2021,5
30,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"What a delectable lunch! I enjoyed the pork burger with fried egg and crunchy onion rings. Every bite was fantastic. The cheddar soup was great, too. Friendly attentive service, hip but laid back atmosphere. What&amp;#39;s not to like?",11/3/2022,5
31,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Be prepared to wait but don&amp;#39;t fret, you can grab a drink as you wait to be seated. There&amp;#39;s a small bar but if it&amp;#39;s crowded, you can wait outside - they have space heaters so you can wait outside even in the cold winter months. Speaking of, the outdoor area is fairly large so I can imagine it&amp;#39;d bea good spot for happy hour in the summer. <br&gt;<br&gt;Despite the crowd, service was fairly quick and friendly. Wings were nothing to rave about but I&amp;#39;d return in the warmer months to give this place another chance.",3/13/2022,3
32,THE FARMHOUSE TAP & GRILL ,Bank St,"burgers,restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"I&amp;#39;ve been staying in the area for a while but I never really get to explore Burlington much because of work. It usually takes someone visiting me in order to do anything so my brother&amp;#39;s appearance helped with getting my to try this place. <br&gt;<br&gt;First, parking is not quite a challenge, but still not super great. Street parking, metered in spots. If you can&amp;#39;t manage to get a spot on the street, there a a few garages that are reasonably priced on the block. Could be worse, but I&amp;#39;d kill for a private lot. <br&gt;<br&gt;We went before the dinner rush so weee able to walk right in and be seated. Greeted pretty quickly and she gave us a reasonable amount of time to look through the menu before she returned. Food came out fast, which is a big plus. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had the dry rubbed chicken wings and collard greens. Didn&amp;#39;t want a huge meal so that worked. It was way more wings that I thought I&amp;#39;d get, which is great at the current price point. They were delicious, sized right, and hit the spot. The collards were okay. Not the best I&amp;#39;d every had and nothing like you&amp;#39;d get in the south. Also got a Stone Fence and it was fabulous. <br&gt;<br&gt;If I&amp;#39;d change anything, I&amp;#39;d tell them to lower the house music. It was at times really hard to hear people talk right next to you. Add someone wearing a mask and it was like being in a club with how well you could hear.",10/16/2021,4
33,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"From the cozy interior, to the fresh food (we saw a farmer drop off stacks of eggs while we sat), to the music selection this was a lovely experience. We made reservations (make them weeks in advance as they will all be gone). I ordered the kale canneloni that came topped with chicken of the woods mushrooms.  Each bite tasted different and made me feel like as if I was foraging through an autumnal woods. Service was friendly and prompt. My husband ordered the bone in pork loin and it looked like something Fred Flinstone would be thrilled to eat.  Perfect charring and cooked to perfection.  Delicious.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh and get the rolls.",3/11/2023,5
34,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"HOLD UP! <br&gt;<br&gt;We were visiting the area and got recommendations to go here which was a good confirmation since we had planned on going anyways through previous research. <br&gt;<br&gt;When I tell you we were blown away by how amazing this place would be an understatement. The place was a little crowded but we were able to sit at the bar. The bartender and servers were amazing! Ran us through the menu, gave drink pairings for our meals, and literally were the nicest people ever. I love that. Now onto the food. YES. First get the rolls, they&amp;#39;re sooooooo good. Which is a lot because bread is usually well bread. Yet they did it so well. They are farm to table so the menu does change often but I got the hanger steak with cabbage. I usually hate cabbage but they prepared it so delicious that I almost forgot this is a veggie I usually am not a fan of. Drinks were excellent as well! The decor was very homey and rustic. If you&amp;#39;re debating on coming here. Don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m not even from the area and would drive back up just to eat here.",2/11/2023,5
35,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"One of the best meals I&amp;#39;ve had the pleasure to enjoy. Started with the rolls and a sampling of cheeses, followed by the beef tartare. Shared a ribeye with some delicious mushrooms and potatoes for our main. Finally, dessert was chocolate pot de crème, which might have been my favorite part. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was fantastic - each dish was explained thoroughly and presented quickly. Recommendations were also given and great. <br&gt;<br&gt;Very cool atmosphere - will be hard to stay away next time I&amp;#39;m in town.",2/4/2023,5
36,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"I can see why this place is so popular. I made reservations for my coworker, my husband, and I for a Monday night at 6:00 pm. And it was hard to find reservations honestly. <br&gt;<br&gt;We parked in the garage next door, first 2 hours were free. We were promptly seated and greeted. The waiter was friendly and sufficient. My husband and I ordered the Parker house rolls, a local cheese that came with toasted slices of bread and jam, abandoned another appetizer that escapes my mind right now. I got the duck for my main, and my husband got the hanger steak. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was all great. My favorite was the local cheese. It was soft and creamy, the jam made the perfect complement to the flavors. The Parker house rolls had flakes of sea salt on it, which were a bit too much for me, so I just picked some of it off. My husband loved them the way they were and devoured 2 right away. The duck was well cooked. We also got dessert, 4 of the ice creams: a cantaloupe sorbet, salted caramel pretzel, honey lavender, and cereal milk. I enjoyed the cantaloupe sorbet the most while my husband loved the cereal milk. <br&gt;<br&gt;This place had great vibes as well with a dark wood decor. It was very Vermont. Can&amp;#39;t wait to come back if we&amp;#39;re in the area!",11/18/2022,5

38,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"Awesome fine dining experience in downtown Burlington. This place offers beautifully executed food and top-level service. I&amp;#39;ve been here a few times and enjoyed my experience.  It may be the top fine dining place in town but still a bit shy from many innovative fine dining places in larger cities. Personally, I think some ingredient/flavor/texture combinations can be improved to be top-notch. <br&gt;<br&gt;Bottom line,  you will have a lovely experience as long as you don&amp;#39;t expect too high.

The service is incredible (thanks Zac) and the food was great! I sat at the chef&amp;#39;s table (a little hot for me) and it was certainly an experience that&amp;#39;s worth writing about. Chef Jordan was right there giving me options on the food choices available. I took them and was pleased. And my server, Zac, was incredible and delivered EXCELLENT service! He listened to my flavor profile from drinks to desserts and it didn&amp;#39;t disappoint. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The scallops were unique and flavorful.

We arrived at 4:45 as a walk-in and requested the chef&amp;#39;s table, we had to wait until 5 to sit. Once seated, the pacing was such that we didn&amp;#39;t have our main course until 6. <br&gt;<br&gt;The entrees were nicely presented and the portions were substantial.<br&gt;<br&gt;The squid and swordfish were nothing special. Yes, it was fresh and the ingredients were high quality, but the taste was nothing more than ordinary. <br&gt;<br&gt;Their menu frequently rotates and they had only 4 entrees from which to choose. I suggest you check the day&amp;#39;s menu in advance",6/21/2022,3
44,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"For our last meal in Burlington we visited Hen Of The Woods. It is a beautiful restaurant and they are taking lots of risks, but I did not feel like they panned out consistently enough in the food we ate.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Quality: The chef adjusts the menu with the seasons, so maybe we hit a weird moment, but I was not overly impressed by our meal. The Parker House Rolls were a good start, but neither of our appetizers, Halibut Crudo or Romanesca Cauliflower, impressed me. I felt the Crudo was extremely fishy, which I don&amp;#39;t know if is usual, but would push me away from that fish selection. The Romanesca Cauliflower was beautifully presented, but bland in flavor. The Duck was okay, with the meat being prepared well, however the flavor profile it was matched with was odd. We ended with a delicious Roasted Apple dessert, the cheddar ice cream was incredible.<br&gt;Quantity: The dish sizes seemed fair for the prices.<br&gt;Value: $7 for the Parker House Rolls. $18 for the Halibut Crudo. $16 for the Romanesca Cauliflower. $40 for the Duck. $8 for the Polenta. $14 for the Roasted Apples.<br&gt;Ambiance: After visiting the Waterbury location of Hen Of The Woods, decided to try out the Burlington one during our visit. It sits in the bottom floor of a hotel and can be tough to find. The inside has a similar decor as the other location, but lacks the same authentic fun. Harder to built a cozy cabin in the middle of the city than out in the wilderness. However, I will say they made an admirable attempt, with lots of wood elements, romantic lighting, and a certain warmth from the kitchen.<br&gt;Crowd: Reservations in advance are needed, we ended up with a late slot from waiting too long.<br&gt;Service: Felt a little sporadic at the end of the night.<br&gt;Parking: Near a large garage.",11/8/2022,3

I was told it was THE spot to go in Burlington, and yes the service was IMPECCABLE and the atmosphere was beautiful, but overall the food was overpriced and not entirely worth it. The cheese platter was a good sampling of local varieties which was nice, but it took almost an hour to get my steak and it came out cold. I can see this being a nice place to take a date or celebrate a special occasion, but treating myself here on a solo date wasn&amp;#39;t the best experience for a nice meal.",3/1/2023,3

I was able to set a notification on Resy (the reservation app) and it alerted me when I time became available so we made it in. Got the pork belly appetizer which we liked, but what really made an impact was the shareable ribeye that we got! It was buttery and delicious, served with blue cheese crumbles sprinkled on top and in a pan alongside some hen of the woods and brussel sprouts. I&amp;#39;ll be thinking about this dish for awhile...",10/26/2022,5
50,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"Holy moly 10/10! My husband and I own a restaurant just north of Boston and can be hard to impress but the Hen did it! <br&gt;<br&gt;Our server was awesome. We forget her name, but she had red hair and braids last night. The way she explained the menu and was knowledgeable of the ingredients they used was a breath of fresh air. You don&amp;#39;t find much of that these days. The waitress for the table next to us also seemed incredibly knowledgeable. They train their staff well! <br&gt;<br&gt;The food, wow. The oysters were small and sweet, the habanero mignonette was exceptional. We selected a couple different cheeses that paired well with their crackers and of course we got the rolls, top notch. <br&gt;<br&gt;We then proceeded to get the duck pastrami which was a little sweet, a little savory and very tender. We loved it. <br&gt;<br&gt;After that, we got the Ribeye (normally a dinner for 2 people) but we also couldn&amp;#39;t help but get the monkfish as well. The monkfish was good, not sure we&amp;#39;d order again but we did enjoy it. The ribeye was like butter!! I have never had a ribeye (bone out btw) that was so tender and cooked to perfection. It was paired with a charred cabbage (SO GOOD) and wild mushrooms that brought all those earthy tones together. <br&gt;<br&gt;We of course got dessert :) 2 cappuccinos, perfectly foamed. Pumpkin cake (deconstructed) with a salty cheesecake like mousse and my husband got the chocolate brownie served with ice cream. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seriously looking forward to our leaf peeping trip next year to come back to this place. Keep it up Hen!",10/3/2022,5
51,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"We were in NH and Vermont for leaf peeping and this was the best meal we had on our trip. It reminded us of a place we have in Cincinnati called Sotto. It&amp;#39;s dark, bustling with energy, and fun. Our server Nick was efficient and friendly. It was our last night in VT, so we didn&amp;#39;t want to order too much because we couldn&amp;#39;t take anything home. So we started with the Parker House Rolls and Cottage Ham. Eaten together it was a salty, homey, start to our meal. We then had the Halibut Crudo, which was fabulous, and the Soft Shell Shrimp, which we probably wouldn&amp;#39;t order again. Upon reading recommendations from Yelp, we ordered the smoked cabbage, which was one of the best dishes we&amp;#39;ve had in our life! Even if you don&amp;#39;t like cabbage, you have to try this!! I wish we lived closer because we would eat here all the time.",10/13/2022,5

We also chose to sample two of the cheese specials - one of the goat options and one of the raw milk options (the bartender chose for us). SOOO GOOD.  The atmosphere is nice, just dark and a bit loud. It&amp;#39;s busy for a reason. They recommend reservations, but we arrived at 5:30 and snagged the last two seats at the bar.

57,HEN OF THE WOOD ,Phot,"newamerican,restaurant",3,4.5 ,"I agree with others here that this restaurant is not worth the hype. I was expecting to be wowed, both due to reports from co-workers who&amp;#39;ve dined here and based on the prices, but it was just okay. Some dishes were hits, some were misses, and overall we left feeling underwhelmed. Maybe it was because we dined here in early spring when there wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of exciting produce for the chef to work with? I&amp;#39;m not sure. <br&gt;<br&gt;The standout dish for me was the squid with country ham and breadcrumbs that was really savory and a textural delight between the perfectly tender squid, crispy chewy bits of country ham (very high-quality meat), and crispy breadcrumbs. The standout dish for my husband was the cheese plate, which I thought was just fine but he was enamored with. We also got the much-lauded Parker house rolls (they were okay, and we didn&amp;#39;t end up finishing them), beets with feta (I&amp;#39;ve made better beet and feta salads at home), lamb sausage pappardelle (very tasty and on par with what you&amp;#39;d find at an upscale Italian restaurant), and the swordfish with radish top pesto (swordfish was bland and the pesto too bitter). I was annoyed that some of the pieces of asparagus that came with my swordfish didn&amp;#39;t have the woody ends trimmed off. Normally I would let that go but when you&amp;#39;re paying $35 for that dish, you&amp;#39;re expecting them to know how to prep asparagus. <br&gt;<br&gt;Portions were fair for an upscale restaurant, and our total bill with wine came out to around $200 for 2. The service was top-notch, and the atmosphere is lovely and intimate. I would maybe give them another shot, but in a city with a lot of more exciting restaurants, it may not be for a while.",10/3/2022,3

Unfortunately I expected more considering the pricetag. <br&gt;<br&gt;We did have a very attentive waiter who was willing to explain everything on the menu from top to bottom. We ended up ordering the parker house rolls, poussin, fish, and fried green tomatoes. The fried green tomatoes were wonderfully crisp and tangy. The parker house rolls were AMAZING. Soft, fluffy, buttery, a hint of salt. Really, just everything you could look for in a good roll. The fish may have been my favorite entree, tender fish with plenty of fresh herbs and vegetables to make the dish feel filling yet light. <br&gt;<br&gt;The poussin, on the other hand, was a letdown. It was tender and well seasoned, but it didn&amp;#39;t wow me like the other dishes. It just felt, very...basic. Especially for the price we had paid!<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I feel conflicted. I&amp;#39;m sure this is a wonderful place to share a bottle of wine and some charcuterie, cheese, and other accoutrements.

When I looked around, it seemed like everybody was having fun with their food, so I think it was probably worth it.<br&gt;<br&gt;RIGHT ON THE MONEY!!!!!<br&gt;<br&gt;As an appetizer, we decided to share the sesame tuna and duck quesadillas. To put it another way, that was an EXCELLENT decision considering the fact that they were both remarkable!!!<br&gt;<br&gt;The Roasted Beet Salad with Chicken was what I went with for the main course. This is something that I frequently do, and I have to say that it ranks among the top two experiences that I&amp;#39;ve ever had!!! Was it #1!?!?!?

I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi which I had read on the menu weeks prior and was so excited about.  This dish was astoundingly bad, I actually couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. It  just doesn&amp;#39;t taste like anything at all? I couldn&amp;#39;t get a hint of a single flavor, no pumpkin, no cheese. It was bizarre.  Not sure what went wrong here, but for the price point (this cost more than the delicious walleye special) this was such a huge disappointment.  I watched the table next to us have a similar experience with the gnocchi unfortunately.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The things that were great here were really great.  We would go back and probably stick to the specials and apps.  Loved the cocktails, ambiance, and beer selection!",12/20/2022,3

I am not a huge bourbon person, but this made me reconsider...<br&gt;- Old Fashioned- a classic<br&gt;- Espresso Martinis- not on the menu, but, these were some of the best espresso martinis we had EVER had. Super fresh, watched them make it... a perfect blend of smooth, sweet, strong... not a typical Baileys loaded drink- purely tasted like espresso with a punch. 10/10 would recommend!<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, fantastic experience here.

The Mushroom ragout Gnocchi was massive bundles of mushrooms maybe 8 gnocchis didn&amp;#39;t have much flavor. My husband asked for well done and got medium... so he only ate half of it... no one came to ask how everything was and what we thought. <br&gt;<br&gt;Was $75 for barely any service and mediocre food <br&gt;<br&gt;Only positive was the hosts were very sweet,10/12/2021,1
110,JUNIPER BAR & RESTAURANT ,Cherry St,"restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,How many describes a Food very elegantly but when you get your dish very very big let down. The mushroom gnocchi had about six pieces of gnocchi and some thing I can only be described as very bland sauce. A dish just had absolutely no flavor. The service and the servers are amazing. The cocktails can be really good unfortunately there is some inconsistency with some of the bartenders and the drinks aren&amp;#39;t always the same.<br&gt;Can&amp;#39;t really say it&amp;#39;s worth the cost.,2/1/2022,2
111,JUNIPER BAR & RESTAURANT ,Cherry St,"restaurants,tradamerica",2,4.0 ,"Brunch is the best. Especially brunch with a bloody mary bar and local cheese plates. Find both these things, and more, at Juniper.<br&gt;<br&gt;A Sunday on vacation should always start with brunch, and when Yelping best brunches in Burlington, Juniper kept popping up on our radar. This restaurant is part of a hotel, and located right next to the lobby entrance. It is beautiful. We were seated really quickly, after being greeted with live jazz in the hotel lobby. <br&gt;<br&gt;First things first, I started with a bloody Mary. They bring it to the table already made, and you can add all your faves like olives, pickled veggies and lotttsss of hot sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;My boyfriend ordered the Mimosa but made with fresh apple juice. Sounds weird, but it was so good!<br&gt;<br&gt;We got a bunch of stuff to split starting with a local cheese board. I would like to give an ode to this board. It was $10 and came with three different, local cheeses that were to die for. My favorite was the Jasper Hill blue cheese that has won multiple awards for being the best blue cheese in the world. Yes, you read that right! There was no shortage of cheese on this plate, and I seriously couldn&amp;#39;t believe it was just $10.<br&gt;<br&gt;We also ordered the Benedict which had smoked pork loin. These eggs were so fresh, and I loved every bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;The miss for me was the Duck Eggs and steamed greens. It sounded cool, but compared to the benny it lacked flavor.<br&gt;<br&gt;All in all this is a solid spot for brunch. Service is super friendly, and although we got our food rather quickly, it also seems like a spot you can linger with food, friends and a cocktail.",9/20/2018,4

Not your Grandma&amp;#39;s carrots, and that&amp;#39;s a compliment :)<br&gt;* Porchetta - seared and cooked perfectly. Ideal for cold weather.<br&gt;* Fingerling potatoes - spot on with a great crispy skin.<br&gt;* Mushroom ragout - easily the star of the whole meal!!!

One waitress for about 9 tables she did amazing and we didn&amp;#39;t wait long for our food. I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily call this place farm to table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Endive salad- the anchovies and grapefruit clashed. The anchovies were a little overpowering maybe if they went with another brand it would&amp;#39;ve gone better<br&gt;<br&gt;Beef pot roast- it was a bit dry. Tasty but it needed more liquid on it. Not enough for the meat.<br&gt;<br&gt;Side Brussels sprouts- undercooked<br&gt;<br&gt;Side maple carrots- too much maple syrup. Carrot got lost.<br&gt;<br&gt;Cheddar fritters with maple butter- these were the best. I would highly recommend ordering this,1/30/2021,3

The breakfast sandwich was simple and tasty and the kid&amp;#39;s breakfast was a nice helping of everything. Neither were perfect. The potatoes were overcooked. The blueberry pancakes were full of wild blueberries, but the syrup, albeit sourced locally, had an odd taste unlike any other Vermont maple syrup.

For me, it was all about the blueberry pancake - both in presentation and flavor. I could have guzzled the entire bottle of maple syrup. Maybe it was partly due to the romanticism of chowing on maple syrup in the land of maple syrup? <br&gt;<br&gt;The bartender/server was very friendly and allowed me to do my thang.

I said I can wait and put my name on the wait list. After 40 minutes or so I got text saying my new wait time was 30 minutes.

One review mentioned how difficult it can be to get a reservation, but you might have luck for bar seating if you show up right at 5 - so that&amp;#39;s what we did and am I glad!!<br&gt;<br&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t say enough good words about this place. The flavor profiles for each dish were masterfully thought-out. Each mezze was the perfect size for two people to share. Cocktails were unique and so yummy!<br&gt;<br&gt;We began with the Baba Ganoush and Za&amp;#39;atar Garlic Knot. Absolutely delicious! I wanted to lick the plate clean. Next was the carrots and zucchini mezze - both had such unique flavors and perfectly crafted textures. The haloumi was another favorite dish. So simple, but I wanted ten more plates of it.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was our first time trying spanakopita, and this one was fantastic. There was a subtle lime flavor that went perfectly with the spinach and the tangy feta cheese.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Harissa chicken wings would be a stand-out dish at any other restaurant, but they were the least memorable compared to the other plates. I constantly saw them coming out of the kitchen, so they must be a very popular dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;We finished with the strawberry-rose sorbet - so fresh! Rose can sometimes be overpowering in dishes, but again, the flavors were balanced artfully. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our bartender (wish I had gotten their name) was so helpful with orienting us to the menu, giving recommendations, and checking on us throughout our meal.

132,HONEY ROAD ,Church St,"mideastern,restaurant",2,4.5 ,I&amp;#39;m not a fan of salad but the Kale Salad here was sooooo good. It was crunchy and flavorful. Definitely my favorite dish. The Babaganoush was ģood but the portion size was small. The Harissa Chicken wings came in sixes and were great tasting. I was disappointed in the Lamb Kofta - I didn&amp;#39;t even want to take the leftovers home. We only had their Rose Lemonade which came in cute glasses and had a sweet/tart taste to it - not bad at all. This place is at a prime location so they could charge a lot per plate. Just be prepared to pay or starve.,6/25/2022,4
133,HONEY ROAD ,Church St,"mideastern,restaurant",2,4.5 ,Experience was OK.... The food quality was amazing but prices were too high for the amount of food. You needed many many plates to feed two people which becomes pretty $$$ when the dishes are high.,12/30/2022,4

Spanakopita was decent, though slightly oily and not quite what I expected - a small round portion for $18. I am not a fan of baklava typically, but their baklava took me by surprise. Very, very good baklava - the flavor, texture, slight warmth from the cinnamon. The baklava is perfect. But the fact that if you get the whipped feta, hummus, muhammara, or babaganoush you get just that - just the dip alone, nothing accompanying it. Pita is separate ($3), and as are crudités (listed as &amp;#34;assorted vegetables&amp;#34; for $8.) This is unheard of me to, generally these sorts of plates would come with pita and/or veg included. As another reviewer said, to charge separately for those items feels strange and like being nickled-and-dimed. Especially as it is such small plates to begin with for any of their mezes, but at an average of $18 or so each.",2/25/2023,3

144,HONEY ROAD ,Church St,"mideastern,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"This was dinner #1 of my anniversary weekend in Burlington a few weeks ago (and secretly my most-anticipated dinner since I absolutely love Middle Eastern mezze-style restaurants). There were some high highs and some lows, but overall we had a solid dinner. Here&amp;#39;s my breakdown of what we ordered:<br&gt;-Kale Salad: 5/5 stars. My favorite dish of the night. I don&amp;#39;t even really like kale, but the copious amounts of crunchy quinoa on top was like nothing else I&amp;#39;ve ever had. A textural masterpiece, and quite a big portion too. <br&gt;-Braised Lamb Chops: 4/5 stars. The lamb itself was delightful, and my husband&amp;#39;s favorite bite of the night. Very tender and beautifully spiced. However, the smoky eggplant puree (tasted like baba ghanoush) that it was served on top of didn&amp;#39;t compliment the lamb and if anything, seemed to drown out the flavor of it. It was also begging for a grain to go with it like pita or couscous. <br&gt;-Harissa Chicken Wings: 3/5 stars. The sweet harissa sauce was pleasant enough, but forgettable. The chicken was cooked well but needed more flavor (perhaps a brine or marinade?).<br&gt;-Grilled Octopus: 2/5 stars. Oh dear. This was my most-anticipated dish, but it turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the night. We almost considered sending it back because the octopus was so tough and overcooked. It was also aggressively sour due to what tasted like a lemon marinade, which might have been what led to it becoming so overcooked. I order octopus every chance I get, yet this was the worst octopus preparation I&amp;#39;ve ever had in a restaurant. I will say the beans and crackers that came with the octopus were both delicious. <br&gt;-Tahini and Halvah Sundae: 5/5 stars. We were on the fence about ordering dessert, but I&amp;#39;m so glad we did, because this saved the night after the mezze we ordered got progressively worse and worse. The tahini ice cream was sublime, especially paired with the tahini caramel and the halvah. I was on cloud nine while eating this. It is very sweet, but I didn&amp;#39;t mind one bit. <br&gt;<br&gt;Prices were fair for the kind of restaurant this is and for the portions we got. We left pretty stuffed and spent about $100 total. The restaurant itself has a nice, trendy ambience without being obnoxious. Our waitress did a great job. The bathrooms are funky and cool with great music. This place has a lot of potential, but the execution needs a bit more work for it to truly be great.",6/7/2022,4
145,HONEY ROAD ,Church St,"mideastern,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"The small plates ranged from very good (kale salad, shrimp, baba ganoush, pita) to just ok (trout) with some dishes being too salty. Garlic knot is like a big soft filling pretzel. Cocktails and service were excellent. Music was loud &amp;#39;70s era.",1/28/2023,4
146,HONEY ROAD ,Church St,"mideastern,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"We did take out for lunch and sat outside. It was delicious! We got the eggplant sabich, the whipped feta, the zucchini fries, and the tahini sundae. It was not cheap, but we weren&amp;#39;t expecting it to be. My partner is still talking about the zucchini fries. My favorite was the tahini sundae! What a fun and creative idea.",8/22/2021,5
147,HONEY ROAD ,Church St,"mideastern,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"Wildly underwhelming. Started as soon as we walked in the door when the two at the host station didn&amp;#39;t acknowledge us even though we were staging literally 2 feet from them. Eventually they stopped talking to each other and we were seated. The cocktails were good, the two dips we had were good, but the 5 plates we shared lacked any sort of pizazz. They were somewhere between meh and fine, which is not at all what we were expecting from the hype. <br&gt;<br&gt;Shnitzel lettuce wraps were supposed to be spicy and didn&amp;#39;t have even a hint of a kick. Tasted like a chicken finger wrapped in lettuce.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Lamb kofta was recommended by our server as but to be missed. Lamb was dry and flavor was off. Only ate half of them. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cod loin in the stew was nice and flaky, but everything else in the stew seemed to contradict the flavor of the broth rather than complement it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Server never asked how anything was and seemed completely uninterested in even being there. At one point we wondered if she had forgotten we existed as she touched the tables around us and never stopped to take our initial food order.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had been looking forward to this for long time and we&amp;#39;re super excited to try it out. All in all I&amp;#39;d rate it as disappointing. Don&amp;#39;t believe the hype.",3/12/2022,2

Fine. Headed to red square inn for a beer while we waited.<br&gt;<br&gt;At 6:30 my partner went to check on table and they assured him it would be ready in 20 minutes or less. At 6:50 I get a call that they&amp;#39;ve run out of food and are closing early. My family and I were in disbelief that 1) they ran out of food and 2) they had us wait an hour for the table before telling us, especially when there was an opportunity to tell my partner about the situation when he checked in 20 minutes prior. <br&gt;<br&gt;Terrible customer service and consideration.",6/21/2021,1

Mediterranean spices but not so heavy that it overwhelmed your tastebuds. Everything was perfectly seasoned. My husband is a very picky eater and knows his wings. He loved the wings. The wings were sweet with a slight kick due to the seasoning but again perfectly cooked. Well done. The meals are a good portion and reasonably priced. Also, appreciated that they still practiced some social distancing by only allowing take out and patio seating to keep both their customers and staff safe. Highly recommend this place.",7/2/2021,5

Large open setup with the bakery in the back and counter service for ordering. <br&gt;<br&gt;Between two people, ordered the Maple Biscuit ($4), Apple Turnover ($4), Avocado Toast ($13), and two lattes ($4 each). Loved the apple turnover - flaky crust and flavorful filling without being too sugar forward. Maple biscuit has a nice crust and a large burst of maple if that&amp;#39;s your thing. The avocado toast comes on a thick slice of multi grain bread that tastes fresh - and a good chunky avocado top.

We all wanted them however they were gone at 1PM. <br&gt;<br&gt;One of the special of the day was polenta with cured salmon. The polenta was excellent and creamy without being cheese and cream heavy. <br&gt;Personally I didn&amp;#39;t like the chicken BanhMi as it had parsley instead of cilantro. Dnt get me wrong: if considered as just a sandwich it is 10/10 however it was not mentioned to me while ordering (the menu had cilantro).<br&gt;<br&gt;Their coffee is great and a few other drinks are also great. The avocado toast was fresh and the bread is crispy and doesn&amp;#39;t get soggy.

The food has stayed great, pastries and savory sandwiches alike. <br&gt;<br&gt;I do however need to put in my two cents about a change that has diminished the homey feeling August First used to have. The transition from traditional, dishwasher plates to non-reusable take-out boxes. To me, this not only generates unnecessary waste, it also create an atmosphere of quantity of customers over quality of experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;I understand the need for take-out during the pandemic and the cost increase in hiring a dish washer, but in the end, I do not want to go to a place that does not give me an option to reduce the trash I create. It makes me a little sad that so many people are okay to go along with this decision. <br&gt;<br&gt;I have much love for the management (M&amp;amp;F), but I have to be honest in saying that this is something that is really pushing me away from visiting, and I will likely not come back until I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about being a part of the problem.<br&gt;<br&gt;5 stars for the food and people<br&gt;2 stars for the decision to waste this much",1/28/2023,3

At 10:45am on a Monday, there was a line as expected because the food and especially their baked goods (fresh baked bread and pastries) is That good. The hot chocolate cookie $1.50 is Outstanding. Chili and cinnamon gives it a nice kick of flavor and the coarse sugar on top adds just the right amount of crunch.",8/22/2022,5

Cheese curds had a nice extra zest to them without the greasy feel. <br&gt;<br&gt;Split a burger and the Mac and cheese.

189,DEEP CITY ,Lake St,"brewpubs,cocktailbars,food,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"Really disappointed in this restaurant. We overall did not have a good time or particularly enjoy the food. We wanted to go to Hen of The Wood but they were completely booked. This was the next place with 4.5 stars so we made a resy well in advance. When we arrived the hostess checked us in and then picked up a phone call which we thought was a little weird. We were sat at a more community table / picnic style next to a party of 6. We immediately asked for one of the open tables of two and wirier checking the hostess said no due to other reservations (we also reserved so this was confusing why other groups of twos reservations had priority over ours), we were out for Valentine&amp;#39;s Day. Finally we asked our waiter and he was able to talk to the host and we were moved. As you can imagine, several of the tables of two were never filled with these &amp;#34;reservations&amp;#34; he mentioned. Throughout the night there was atleast 3 tables of two empty at all times. This was overall odd and a little upsetting. The next thing we did not like was the wait. It took almost one hour+ for our food to come out. Again, not a busy restaurant and we ordered a burger (super thin burger) and the pork chop (dry and had little to no flavor). The restaurant did have parking out front which was nice and lake champain is across the way which is nice for a pre-dinner or post-dinner stroll. Our waiter was absolutely amazing, incredibly kind and sweet. The food is very mid and price range is $15-25 for entrees and like 5-10 for small bites like fries or bread. The restaurant was playing pretty loud music as well. It&amp;#39;s almost have a vibe of a cafe that was converted into s dinner restaurant. Unfortunately our experience with the waiter started things off rough and we continued to be disappointed.",2/20/2023,2

The Gumbo was also on point and delish complete with spicy andouille sausage.   The manager brought over grilled bread so I could better soak up the sauce!  I&amp;#39;m sorry that there are no pictures of the food but I was too busy eating. <br&gt;<br&gt;Blueberry Peach cobbler for dessert was amazing.",9/11/2022,5

We tripped over this place it while watching the sunset over Lake Champlain. we yelped for some local food and Deep City came up. We didn&amp;#39;t know if we&amp;#39;d get in as it was a Sunday night and Burlington is a college town. The only empty table in the place was reserved, but, it was reserved for 7pm so we had just over and hour before we&amp;#39;d need to book it. Perfect! We got the table and a round of drinks. The restaurant was hopping but food and drinks were coming out fast. <br&gt;<br&gt;The special that night was mussels in broth with garlic steamed in a local IPA from the brewery next door. I got that. They came with a nice crunchy piece of bread with a perfect char (I love a good crunchy bread, so I was in heaven).  The portion was definitely sharable. My nephew got the vegan poutine fries heaped with pickled mushrooms and cashew cheese.  He could not eat them fast enough! My daughter got the Chicken Fried Chicken sandwich with fries, the sandwich was as big as her head. I didn&amp;#39;t get a bite but she horked it! Her only complaint was she wanted the slaw on the side. So if that&amp;#39;s your thing, ask for slaw on the side.<br&gt;<br&gt;The staff were super accommodating, our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items. She answered our questions and offered some information on where our food came from. I can&amp;#39;t say how grateful we were that they let us have a reserved table. We made sure we didn&amp;#39;t linger, we paid and were done in time for them to clean and seat the next party.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The atmosphere is fun, hipster, trendy and overall pretty cool. Décor is funky and artsy, full bar, large selection of beer and wine as well as special cocktails. I found the prices reasonable considering the location, Burlington is a pretty popular touristy type place mixed with that College vibe. This place is good for a crowd lots of family style tables in the middle with tables scattered around the edge. The bar looked cool, I didn&amp;#39;t use the restrooms but my family said they were decent. Not sure if there was Wi-Fi there we didn&amp;#39;t bother to ask. Every seat was full the night we were there. It was not hard to have a conversation, the noise level was fine. I will take every opportunity I can get to go back and explore the menu more.

Both dishes came out hot and delicious, I couldn&amp;#39;t believe the poutine was vegan. Also enjoyed the beet salad although I was surprised it was a warm dish it was still really flavorful and beets were perfectly cooked.

We started with the kale salad -salads come in full and 1/2 portions. The dressing was tangy and a few slices of watermelon radish and pepitas polished this off well. We then had the root veggie curry and the calabaza-which is roasted acorn squash with a tasty black bean purée.. Both were outstanding-simply wonderful. This place makes veggies sing! We then tried the mussels-they were plump and juicy but the broth was a little bland. For dessert we had the blueberry lemon cake which was super moist and served with a lovely ice cream and candied lemon peel.

I am a meat eater but my boyfriend is not, so to find a place where the food is not only incredible but we can both eat it and enjoy it?? Wild. We had the vegan blue cheese salad and the korean seitan (OMG) to start, then the four veggie ravioli (the sage and butter pecan sauce was unbelievable) and the seitan piccata (the mashed potatoes &amp;amp; capers!!! wow!) Then for dessert we had the vanilla maple cake, which if you&amp;#39;re struggling to choose from their awesome list of desserts, here&amp;#39;s your sign to order that. It was sooooo good.

We typically go up the street to Stone Soup, but were looking for a change of venue. This came highly recommended and after visiting, we could easily see why. This is not your typical ramen/rice bowl kinda&amp;#39; place. The chefs really know how to create, flavor, and present truly gourmet vegan food. Among other selections, we tried and I highly recommend the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Seitan Picatta and vegan Caesar salad. They get top marks for flavor and presentation.

We were told that they weren&amp;#39;t sure how long the wait was and so we scooted over to try to wait it out. About 30 seconds later server came over and said that it was going to be at least a 45 minute wait. That&amp;#39;s cool - we didn&amp;#39;t have a reservation and clearly it&amp;#39;s a packed house. We had a vegan in our party and she was so excited about trying this place out - so we were about to sit to wait in the little waiting area, when a server rudely asked what we were doing. And when we said we were just going to wait, he said there was no way we would be seated before the kitchen closed.<br&gt;<br&gt;Which we were confused, but sure - we understand. We asked for  recommendations for other places that would have a vegan dishes. And his response was what put it over the top and made me write this review up - We aren&amp;#39;t in the business of tell you about our competitors. Also we still sat down to yelp other places to go to, the server gave us terrible stink eye. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ummmm ... we were willing to wait, we were polite and understanding about the limitations of your restaurant and staff, but seriously you could have given us some direction.

The ambience was calm, soothing and friendly; the music was absolutely stellar with sprinklings of Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell, and the food was enough to dash our restaurant etiquette and have us practically lapping at our plates. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the vegan nachos as our appetizer and it was as impeccable in taste as it was in presentation - each nacho burst with flavor. I followed with the vegan Laksa Noodle Pot which I can only describe as being so scrumptious I might as well have grabbed a straw - the broth was beautifully peppered with coconut and spices and the noodles were light as air. My wife enjoyed THE burger which we thought earned its name as it was wonderful; we also ordered an extra side of the sweet potatoes it came with as the sauce was perfect. We finished with the coconut pie as well as the maple pecan between us which, as you can guess, was heavenly. <br&gt;<br&gt;A shoutout to our server who was incredibly sweet and offered her suggestions which we took onboard and ordered ourselves - thank you!<br&gt;<br&gt;All around, an amazing place.

247,RED PANDA ,Church St,"himalayan,indpak,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"As a connesuer of Indian food and more recently Nepalese food, I was looking forward to my dinner tonight. My order consisted of mango lassi, aloo kulcha, daal soup, chicken pakoras, vegetable samosas, white rice and butter chicken. <br&gt;<br&gt;As is always the case when I eat Indian food, I order all the basic items with medium heat so I can compare restaurants evenly. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here is a breakdown of my order:<br&gt;<br&gt;Mango lassi - store bought, prepackaged. Disappointed it wasn&amp;#39;t fresh, it was overly sweet and not much flavor to it other than sugar. <br&gt;<br&gt;Aloo kulcha - I didn&amp;#39;t get to try, it was forgotten from my dash order. <br&gt;<br&gt;Daal soup - easily the best dish I had tonight. Flavorful, spicy. I poured it over rice. It was lovely. Highly recommend. <br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken pakoras - prepared similar to boneless chicken wings with a red sauce but without the spice. Flat, uninspired flavor. <br&gt;<br&gt;Vegetable samosas - minimal spice, almost no savoriness, almost like eating plain mashed potatoes wrapped in dough. <br&gt;<br&gt;White rice - fluffy, not sticky or dry. Perfectly cooked. No cardamom pods or saffron added for flavor. <br&gt;<br&gt;Butter chicken - sadly was very disappointing. Tasted little better than Campbell&amp;#39;s tomato soup with chunks of chicken in it. No heat, no flavor. If it wasn&amp;#39;t for the onion and green pepper in it, it wouldn&amp;#39;t have had any flavor or substance at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall very disappointing dinner. The food items alone added up to $59, with delivery, tax and tip it totaled $80. Not even close to worth it. <br&gt;<br&gt;If I go back, which I highly doubt I will, I&amp;#39;ll get two or more orders of the daal soup, some rice and the aloo kulcha so I can try it. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for great Indian food, go to Masala Elaichi.

What a delightful dining experience! <br&gt;<br&gt;After looking for a spot to have a special dinner in Burlington, we narrowed it down to two restaurants -- Trattoria Delia and another one. We were able to snag reservations for Saturday night at the former and from the moment we walked in we knew we had chosen the right spot.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance at this restaurant was just magical. The dimmed lights, wooden tables, and wall decor gave it a romantic and intimate vibe. We felt transported from the minute we walked inside.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was also exceptional from beginning to end. Staff was attentive and so knowledgeable.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food was incredible! I had the stuffed quail -- something I haven&amp;#39;t seen before at a restaurant -- and it was exquisite. On a bed of risotto and topped with mushrooms, the portions were generous and the different flavors just complimented each other. My partner had the short rib, and he loved it as well. We finished with the chocolate cake which was way too rich for my taste, but delicious nonetheless.<br&gt;<br&gt;The wine and cocktail list was also extensive! We chose a red for our dinner. All in all, we spent $160 for the two of us with two main entrées, a nice bottle of wine, dessert, and 20% tip. <br&gt;<br&gt;I can&amp;#39;t wait to come back! This was an exceptional dinner from start to end.",5/10/2022,5

Most of their pasta is made in house although there are 2-3 kinds that are imported. Our order took about 15-20 mins to get done.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had a specialty pasta with prosciutto and peas. It came with pancetta instead of prosciutto and had no peas. Wine was great on the other hand and so was fresh bread. Butter was very cold and hard to spread on the bread. We also ordered a cake and a cannoli for dessert but cannoli was never delivered.<br&gt;<br&gt;In the end, for $120 you get nice interior, mediocre food, good wine, and subpar service. I was expecting a lot more from this restaurant given the hype but had a pretty average experience for high price.",5/27/2022,3

Had an amazing maple flavor to them.  I ordered the ragu which was fantastic, and I would suggest you ask for it spicy, which was an off menu request but suggested by our awesome waitress.

We walked quickly and were happy to find that it&amp;#39;s a very cozy restaurant with great service and delicious food.

We walked in and were told that it would be an hour and 15 minute wait for a bar seat, meanwhile there were several open tables on the floor. We decided to walk over to the restaurant next door named Sotto Enoteca and we were seated within a few minutes. We immediately recognized some of the staff from Trattoria Delia as they were seating groups in the same dining room as us and we were very confused. Later on, the waiter confirmed that they were the same restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;We felt uncomfortable knowing that the hostess in the red dress at the sister restaurant told us it would be over an hour wait, but she continued to seat other guests in our dining area. We found it strange that when we were initially turned away at Trattoria Delia, she didn&amp;#39;t offer us the option to seat us in their second dining room at Sotto. She avoided all eye contact as she passed our table several times.That set the mood for our dining experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered calamari, filet mignon, and lobster pasta which were all mediocre. The steak came out rare when we had asked for it to be medium well. The lobster tasted old which was disappointing considering the price. <br&gt;<br&gt;Towards the end of our dinner, a group of 4 young women walked in asking if they had seating available and the waiter turned them away and told them the only open table had a reservation. We left 15 minutes prior to closing and nobody sat at that empty table.<br&gt;<br&gt;It seems like young individuals are not their preferred clientele.

We got lucky and were able to make a reservation last minute for four, so we got a table right away. <br&gt;<br&gt;My family and I love calamari so we ordered it as an appetizer and it was so fresh! Cooked perfectly. For my main course I was looking through some pictures on yelp and saw a white sauce tagliatelle dish that had scallops. I didn&amp;#39;t see it on the menu, but I asked our waiter and he said they could make it. The pasta was delicious, but the scallops kind of had a really weird taste to it. Overall though, the pasta and sauce made up for that. Would highly recommend this one. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, we ordered a tiramisu for the table and oh my goodness I cannot say enough good things about it. You MUST order the tiramisu!

However, I had a huge problem with my waiter last Thursday 12/16/21. Everything was going great until he stopped coming to our table. I tried to get his attention. When we made eye contact I signaled him to come to our table making the hand gesture for &amp;#34;come over here&amp;#34; (pulling my hand toward my face). He never came to my table and ignored me for the rest of the night until he gave me the check. I paid and left, leaving a 20% tip. But I was very troubled by his abrupt change is service so I returned to ask him what happened. I was very polite, but he wasn&amp;#39;t. He said my hand gesture was rude and that he is my server but not my servant. I asked him what made my hand gesture rude? He said I was treating him like a servant. I then asked him how I should have gotten his attention. He said I shouldn&amp;#39;t. Rather I should sit and wait for him to come to my table when he deterred it was necessary! That I had no right to ask him to come to my table and doing so was rude. Then he told me he didn&amp;#39;t have time to talk with me and he walked away.<br&gt;<br&gt;This is the most shocking dining experience of my life and I&amp;#39;ve been going to high-end restaurants for over 40 years. I was not rude. Asking the wait staff to come to my table is normal and appropriate. He is paid to sever the customer. This guy was a total jerk and really bad for Poco&amp;#39;s business. The irony is that he was the rude one, not me. I firmly believe he should quit or be fired. Clearly he doesn&amp;#39;t like or understand the role of waiter.

When we returned after an hour we were told it would be another 45mins. As I looked around the restaurant I saw people who were on like behind us on the waitlist sitting already! The &amp;#34;host&amp;#34; completely ignored our presence when I was trying to check in with her.

The flank steak is tender and extremely flavorful, the catfish entree is awesome as well- slightly spicy with a sweet salsa, the red beans and rice are also standout. They round out the meal nicely and are well seasoned as well. Nothing on the plate lacks flavor! Also Save room for desert, the sweet potato maple cheesecake is literally to die for.",4/17/2022,4

Unfortunately i was in a hurry so i had to get takeout, but it was still a great experience. The decor inside is cozy and the creole/cajun menu completely unlike anything else in Burlington! I got the chance to chat with the owner as he prepared my meal. His passion in the kitchen is obvious and it shines through in the end product. I got the catfish with rice and greens. Everything was full of flavor and just spicy enough to be authentic. I meant to get pictures but i was too busy enjoying my delicious meal!",11/28/2021,5

After trying many of the more popular restaurants on Yelp and finding them overpriced and overrated, discovered this gem after the first review on here talking about the restaurant&amp;#39;s Sweet Potato Maple Cheesecake, the only maple cheesecake in town. <br&gt;<br&gt;Chef Richard Lockwood worked at the original Bourbon Street Grill in Burlington years ago and has had this idea for a restaurant for over a decade. <br&gt;<br&gt;Tried the Cajun Frog Legs, the Duck Ragout, the etoufee, and the fried clam po&amp;#39; boy on special and was impressed by all of them.<br&gt;<br&gt;More than any other restaurant in town, this is the one I recommend.<br&gt;<br&gt;<a href=\""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sevendaysvt.com%2Fvermont%2Fcajun-creole-restaurant-bourbon-street-opens-for-takeout-in-burlington%2FContent%3Foid%3D33106035&amp;amp;s=22a445faed728a05af1092d00e77f4892344f10dbd2780562fb06c54f5bcf776\"" target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""nofollow\""&gt;sevendaysvt.com/vermont/…</a&gt;<br&gt;<br&gt;Best kept secret in Burlington.

Both were tremendous and full of flavor. The food was up there with some of the best Cajun food we&amp;#39;ve had in New Orleans. The jambalaya was well seasoned with just the right amount of heat. The duck ragout was full of flavors and the sauce was on point. We also really appreciated having gluten-free options since one of us has a gluten intolerance. <br&gt;<br&gt;We wrapped up our experience at Bourbon Street by ordering the sweet potato maple cheesecake, which was absolutely amazing and so unique. Highly recommend trying!<br&gt;<br&gt;The owner/chef was kind, attentive and earnest. The service was great. <br&gt;<br&gt;We look forward to trying the other dishes (like gumbo and po boys) the next time we are in Burlington. <br&gt;<br&gt;We highly recommend this truly one of a kind restaurant!",8/24/2021,5

Everything has great flavor, without being overwhelming. We had the shrimp po boy, the blackened catfish, and a slice of the Kentucky bourbon pecan pie. <br&gt;<br&gt;The shrimp for the po boy was cooked plump and tender, the roll was light and slightly flaky, and the aioli was light and complementary, not overpowering. <br&gt;<br&gt;The catfish dish was a great combination of flavors. The catfish had a well-seasoned, peppery outside with an incredibly tender, perfectly cooked texture. It came with red beans and rice, collard greens, and was topped with a pineapple salsa. All of these perfectly complemented the flavor of the fish. The pineapple salsa was bright and sweet to go with the peppery fish. The red beans and rice and collard greens were mellow and savory.<br&gt;<br&gt;The owner is also the chef, the waiter, and the dishwasher and is absolutely amazing. The prices are very reasonable and you can BYOB. The restaurant has been open just a few months but the owner has been a restaurateur for decades. This place is worth a visit!",12/11/2021,5

Will definitely be returning here in the future...many times! Richard is a one-man show: host, chef, server, and he does it all enthusiastically with grace. The food is superb! There are not enough authentic Cajun / New Orleans restaurants to be had by and far so finding Bourbon Street was like finding a treasure! This place is definitely not a chain restaurant. The experience was just right! Great food and a friendly vibe interacting with Richard. He takes much pride in his work and you can tell! We had gumbo to start, crawfish &amp;amp; shrimp etouffe, blackened catfish with red beans &amp;amp; rice and a muffuletta sandwich which is enough to feast on for days! We finished our meal with some awesome desserts: bourbon pecan pie &amp;amp; sweet potato maple cheesecake, both so good.

Others had called this place a hole in the wall- which is true- but the owner has such a passion for him menus.  We came for the frog legs but since I am a bit sensitive to spice, he recommended we stear clear.  We ordered as a appetizer and did enjoy them (maybe he toned down the heat for me). My wife and I really loved the crawfish &amp;amp; shrimp dish he recommended to us.  The sweet potato maple cheese cake was out of this world good.  I definitely recommend Bourbon Street.  Thanks for a wonderful dining memory.  Will visit again!",5/14/2022,5

395,AMERICAN FLATBREAD ,Photo,"breweries,food,pizza,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"The restaurant and bar that I visited during my time in Vermont was without a doubt one of my favorites. The brewery that produces all of the beers that are available on tap is called Zero Gravity, and it is located only a mile or two down the road. Their beers are, to put it mildly, nothing less than fantastic. After landing in Vermont, the first beer I tried was their Conehead IPA, which turned out to be one of my favorites over the course of the entire vacation.<br&gt;<br&gt;Despite the fact that the restaurant is quite large and even has outdoor seating when the weather is nice, I opted to take a seat at the bar. I sampled a variety of beers from them, including their Belgian Crush (a Belgian pale), their Keeper (a Belgian strong pale), their TLA IPA, and their Little Wolf (pale ale). Every single beer that I sampled was an instant favorite of mine. In addition to that, I tried the Dancing Heart flatbread, which turned out to be rather tasty.<br&gt;<br&gt;I had to leave at one point in order to feed more money into my parking meter, and the bartender didn&amp;#39;t give me any trouble about it at all. I presented him with my American Homebrewers Association card and inquired about the availability of membership discounts. He reassured me that there was nothing to worry about, and then he paid for one of my beers! American Flatbread is the place to go to if you enjoy a wide selection of excellent beers, delicious pizza, and friendly service.",2/10/2023,5

We did that and got the Medicine Wheel on half and then the Punctured Equilibrium on the other. The sauce and herbs on the Medicine Wheel was amazing.

434,PASCOLO RISTORANTE ,Church St,"italian,restaurant",2,4.0 ,"I want to start by saying that overall, the food was good. The pasta was delicious and well made.<br&gt;However, the service we received last night was appalling. We are from out of town and saw the reviews and menu while having a drink at another restaurant and decided to give it a try.  my boyfriend walked over to pascolo&amp;#39;s in case we could get a bar seat as it was a busy Saturday night. I waited at the first restaurant in case he couldn&amp;#39;t.<br&gt;<br&gt;When he got to Pascolo&amp;#39;s the bartender told him he could sit at the bar as there were plenty of open bar seats. She got him two waters, and two menus. When I walked over about 10 min later, the hostess said &amp;#34;Excuse me, you cannot sit there&amp;#34;. I told her I was meeting my boyfriend at the bar and received &amp;#34;Yes and he sat there without my permission&amp;#34;  The hostess made my boyfriend get up and told us the bar seats were reserved and that we needed to wait. I want to add that the same person who sat my boyfriend at the bar, also sat a party of three in the bar area who arrived after him and did not have a reservation but they were allowed to remain, while we were told to leave and get on a wait list.<br&gt;<br&gt;Despite this embarrassing and strange situation, we agreed to be added to the wait list and walked around Church St for 30 minutes. When we got the alert to come back, the hostess sat us at the exact same bar which still had several empty seats. The entire  exchange left us with a bad taste in our mouths but I still wanted to try the food.<br&gt;<br&gt;When we did sit down, we ordered drinks, a salad and two pasta dishes. Not once, throughout over an hour wait, were we asked if we wanted another drink despite our empty glasses. The bartenders were clearly frustrated and not very friendly. The pasta took so long that we asked for it to go and still had to wait. As we were waiting, the bartender got off her shift, sat down at the bar and ordered a meal which she got before we got ours. <br&gt;<br&gt;The general attitude of the wait staff was that they were over worked and unhappy. We both felt so disrespected by the entire experience, I would not recommend this place despite the good food.",7/24/2022,1

We saw many other tables available, but understood there were likely late dinner reservations coming in. As we walked up and down Church Street, over a half hour later those tables remained empty.

Not too big but also not too small. Loved how heavily sauced the pappardelle was and the fresh noodles were delicious. The fried sage was an excellent touch. <br&gt;<br&gt;Drinks were incredible as well. Great wine selection which is also reasonably priced along with some tasty cocktails. I got the Chianti and then followed that with a Paper Planes. Highly recommend both!<br&gt;<br&gt;Decided to do the unusual and go for a dessert as well and that was the perfect choice.

That pasta was recommended to us from a near by sitting customer who has been coming here for years. They also serve you warm fresh Italian bread with garlic butter. <br&gt;We sat at the bar and it was a very comfortable atmosphere and very friendly, attentive bar staff. They also have plenty of outdoor patio seating if you&amp;#39;re looking for that option! <br&gt;My only complaint is that the portions were not very big.

They do have a lot of musical acts that we have not made it to yet, but we have gone for dinner often. <br&gt;<br&gt;During good weather, they have a truck stop event and invite all the local food trucks. It gets super crowded, is dog friendly (inside and out!) and is usually a good time. They also serve some of their regular menu offerings from a food truck out back. I am OBSESSED with their pork belly gyro. Perfectly sweet pork belly, crunchy kimchi, and some kind of magic sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ethiopian night - seems to happen once a month or so and a local woman takes over the kitchen. There are no Ethiopian restaurants anywhere nearby so I am super grateful for the option. You have to make reservations beforehand and it does get crowded. Food is pretty good - an odd group of roasted veggies accompanied our meal. Traditional sour injera and the vegetarian platter had the typical lentil curries and greens.

I didn&amp;#39;t have much time, so my review covers food and drink only. Had a Gin N Juice cocktail - tasked good, a bit too sweet for my liking. To start I had the Pork Belly Bao with cucumber - excellent dish. The fresh cucumber and cilantro meshed perfectly with the Pork Belly.  For the main course, I had the Gnocchi - this dish was good, not great. To be honest, there were so many other things that looked interesting on the menu, that I will have to make a second visit. <br&gt;<br&gt;Great, prompt service at the bar.

My friends and I also really love the trivia nights. But I&amp;#39;ve had a few issues with making reservations. Number 1, about 90% of the time when I call there, I end up having to leave a message. Number 2, after leaving said message, I get no response at all. Number 3, because of this, I have to perpetually call and call and call until I get someone on the actual phone/leave multiple messages.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well this time, I went with a group of 6, and we really wanted to do trivia. I had done the aforementioned steps above and got no answer on whether or not we had actual reservations. I figured I&amp;#39;d get there early to try and see if we could snag either an extra table or at least something close by. I was fine with whatever. When I got there, they said they were full. I explained that I did try and call last week, but to no avail. I understand now (after going through this process) that we need a call back/confirmation from a host that we actually have seating. <br&gt;<br&gt;The host then said, &amp;#34;Let&amp;#39;s see what we can do.&amp;#34; While they were trying to accommodate the six of us, I did tell them about how I did definitely leave a message, and that the last time I tried to set up a reservation, no one answered the phone and I had to call multiple times, and finally got so frustrated I ended up posting on the facebook event wall asking about making reservations. Just simply trying to make some sort of conversation happen instead of awkwardly standing in front of the host table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Host: Well you just saw, we answer the phone. If you don&amp;#39;t get a call back from us, you don&amp;#39;t have a reservation.<br&gt;Me: I understand that, I&amp;#39;m just telling you what happened so maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again.<br&gt;Host: If you&amp;#39;re that upset, you don&amp;#39;t have to eat here.<br&gt;<br&gt;Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m really not as upset as they appear to make it, but I&amp;#39;m just simply waiting and I have resting bitch face I guess. But he keeps on and on about how &amp;#34;If i&amp;#39;m that upset, I don&amp;#39;t have to eat here.&amp;#34;<br&gt;To which finally I reply &amp;#34;The more you keep talking about it, the more upset I will become. I just want to wait for my group.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;The Host walked away after that. I could see he was trying to avoid me. My group got there, we sat down, we had a really good time. Apparently a group had cancelled and we were able to get a seat actually inside the events area. The other host was really nice about it, and I had felt bad for being slightly snippy before, so I tried to be grateful and forget about the debacle that got us into the place. I was really appreciative that they did try to find us seating, instead of saying &amp;#34;Hey we&amp;#39;re full I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;#34; but I don&amp;#39;t think the added badgering really helped. It felt almost like the first host really didn&amp;#39;t want us to be there. <br&gt;<br&gt;Still love the food! And the trivia is great when it comes down to it. But sometimes these impressions do last. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll just avoid that host, but there needs to be a better system for making reservations during events like this.",9/21/2016,4

475,ARTSRIOT ,"Pine St, Bur","bars,eventservices,newamerican,nightlife,restaurants,venue",2,4.5 ,"Our experience at Arts Riot was everything I want in a dining experience these days. The food was interesting and well executed, and it was served in a casual laid back setting that was utterly lacking in pretension. The food was fun as was the entire experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu, stamped with the current date, obviously changes somewhat frequently. It differed from the one online, but that worked out well for us, as it featured a couple of things we&amp;#39;d seen elsewhere but that weren&amp;#39;t currently listed on the website. (Yum spicy chicken sandwich!)<br&gt;<br&gt;The brocolini dish, with carrots and farro was straight up incredible. It ranks as one of the best vegetable dishes I&amp;#39;ve had anywhere. The flavors played off of each other perfectly. I know I&amp;#39;ve already used the term once, but the dish just had a playful sense of fun to it. It was brightly colored and looked as good as it tasted. <br&gt;<br&gt;The kimchi pork cheek was also excellent. The meat was tender and delicious. The sauce spicy and full of flavor. Each bite was really a joy to eat. We were torn between several dishes, and while I&amp;#39;m sure that we couldn&amp;#39;t have gone wrong, we were thrilled with our choice. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, we liked our server. He was laid-back and willing to answer the many questions we had about the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, and one last thing. The price was right. It proves that an excellent and innovative meal does need to be out of reach. This is a place that I&amp;#39;d easily feel like I could afford to visit frequently.

482,ARTSRIOT ,"Pine St, Bur","bars,eventservices,newamerican,nightlife,restaurants,venue",2,4.5 ,"The short story: the food is three stars, the price takes it down to two, the burgers are great, avoid the fries.<br&gt;<br&gt;We came in for dinner. We ordered a little burger, a side of fries and the triple hunan bowl, without pork. We were warned that the burger was very little indeed, and went for it. It was tiny. It was basically a slider, but we were warned. It was really delicious, though, and had us thinking we should have both gotten full-size burgers. <br&gt;<br&gt;The fries were utterly negligible. They&amp;#39;d have not been out of place in a diner, aside from the $6 price. Those were not $6 fries, they were $1.50 fries at best. Overly crispy and bland. <br&gt;<br&gt;My food, the triple hunan bowl (without pork) definitely had pork in it.  Like the guy made it, remembered to leave the pork out and fished it out, but missed some pieces. Pretty disappointing when I bit into those bits of oddly-colored &amp;#34;chicken.&amp;#34; The dish itself wasn&amp;#39;t bad, but was very dry and not all that flavorful. It cost $17. I would rate it an $8 bowl at best. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend got a drink. It cost $13, which I think is ridiculous, but it was strong and she really liked it, so... that&amp;#39;s perfectly fair.<br&gt;<br&gt;After dinner we tried a dessert and got the peach... uhh... I forget the name. it was a peach cobbler sticky bun thing with ice cream. It was pretty alright, no real complaints there. I wouldn&amp;#39;t get it again, but it was okay.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress (Zoe) was very nice and capable.<br&gt;<br&gt;In the end I thought the food, minus the burger, was just okay. The prices, though, were taking things too far. $17 for a bland and dry bowl of chinese food and $6 for really awful fries is pretty unforgivable, even for fare in a modern and pleasant hipster setting.<br&gt;<br&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind coming back and trying one of those burgers.

Staff was friendly and really passionate about the food here. You can just feel it when they give their recos of what to try. <br&gt;<br&gt;Food: Popcorn Chicken - Received a basket-full of these and finished every last piece.

504,LEUNIG’S BISTRO ,Church St,"cafes,cocktailbars,french,nightlife,restaurant",2,4.0 ,"The 3 stars I am giving here are for Service (it is excellent, on every level), Bar (excellent bar drinks, excellent bartending, IMPRESSIVELY stocked bar back) and Setting (it was a stunningly beautiful spring evening, sunny, warm temps, Leunig&amp;#39;s had ALL their windows thrown open and tables outside on Church Street - it was GLORIOUS). We had a pretty great time!  There are no stars for food. Leunig&amp;#39;s is an example of trying to do WAY too much and failing. Whoever is in charge of their kitchen needs to take a time out, regroup and simplify. Also get someone to teach them about SEASONING. <br&gt;<br&gt;I started out with their Daily Red Hen Bread because I really needed something to snack on with my Gin and Tonic. It turned out to be Red Hen&amp;#39;s baguette, which is lovely. But was served with pats of commodity butter, not Cabot, not any other local butter.. They did offer and bring a delicious basil pesto that we ate the bread.<br&gt;<br&gt;We then shared White Truffle Fries: tasty, but Cleary a frozen product, perhaps not what you are expecting at a restaurant positioning itself as Leunig&amp;#39;s does. These have one of those weird coatings on them which I am not a fan of. <br&gt;<br&gt;We went on to escargot. I had high hopes. I mean Leunig&amp;#39;s claims to be &amp;#34;classic French cuisine&amp;#34; and really all you need to do is cook snails in butter and garlic...They were fine, except they were completely covered in a layer of melted cheese?  It is too much.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were not put off and ordered the Foie Gras appetizer. Which is when I officially started to have a very bad feeling. Everything on the plate was, at best, room temp. I&amp;#39;m not sure if the poor temp of the food resulted from the fact that the plate was more sculpture (think &amp;#34;Close Encounters&amp;#34;) than food or that it languished somewhere in the kitchen before making it out to us at the bar. Either way, it is unpleasant to be served food that has been sitting out, slowly dying, somewhere. Items on the plate looked lovely, but lacked flavor or seasoning. RED FLAG. We soldiered on!<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered The Caesar salad: Frankly, it was DELICIOUS. I got it without the white anchovies because the waitress told me they are just added whole to the salad, which I find absurd. Of course I also didn&amp;#39;t know the &amp;#34;salad&amp;#34; is just a stack of whole Romaine leaves that you have to navigate yourself with fork and steak knife. Again, absurd. I guarantee no one WANTS to eat their salad that way. Particularly when out for a &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; dinner. This salad would have been semi disastrous on, say, a DATE...<br&gt;<br&gt;Things really committed to the final, death spiral with the Vegan Harissa Cauliflower: the menu claims the cauliflower is both marinated and roasted. It was neither. It appeared to have been steamed at some point in the past, devoid of any seasoning and then stood up in the weird mountain of food moulded together on my plate. It was also, cold. There are a lot of flavors listed on the menu: harissa, sumac, mint, cashew cheese, cumin, Lemon. I detected zero flavor. In anything on this plate. And there was A LOT on this plate. Texture and taste were, to be blunt, abysmal. Really, really bad. Basically everything was either raw or smashed and cold, with zero seasoning. They should never serve this dish again. And/or learn how to season it and get it to the table HOT.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was almost as if someone in the kitchen KNEW how bad I thought the cauliflower entree was and that I was going to order dessert and yelled, &amp;#34;HOLD MY BEER!!!&amp;#34; I ordered the Peanut Butter Pie. It is not pie. In any way, shape or form. It is barely edible. A dry little mound of peanut butter. It would have been 200% better had they served me a jar of Jif with a spoon.This dessert needs to die in a fire.<br&gt;<br&gt;Pretty sure the problem is in the kitchen because everything I witnessed out front was pretty stellar. And of course these plates of food were being created in said kitchen. But that kitchen needs to try again. This time WITH SOME SEASONING.",5/11/2022,3

The location is perfect, right on Church Street, and the service/quality of food is second to none. On my most recent visit, we started with the duck frites with maple dipping sauce and the escargot. The duck frites are always a staple and go quickly - crispy exterior with tender dark meat inside. YUM. I always love escargot, and the garlic/butter and toasted bread didn&amp;#39;t disappoint. <br&gt;<br&gt;It was challenging to choose a main, but I landed on the 1/2 smoked orange duck and wow am I glad I chose that! First of all, the portion is huge, so it was definitely two meals for me (actually a great value at $31). It came with a delicious citrus and fennel slaw, mashed parsnips and a beet puree. Loved it all. The pork and salmon at the table were also delicious. No one had a less than perfect meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;Can&amp;#39;t wait to return!",3/6/2022,5

Price was reasonable, and food was good and decent.<br&gt;<br&gt;3*Vermont sliders trio: lamb, duck, and venison and served on toasted bread. Each had its own distinct flavor.<br&gt;<br&gt;3*Mojito duck tacos: <br&gt;Very healthy dish. The duck was cooked well but bland.  While the dish was decent and I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind ordering it again, I think the dish could be improved in the sense that, it&amp;#39;s a duck taco, therefore it would make sense to add other ingredients that accentuate the duck. Instead the duck essentially replaces beef or pork in a otherwise normal taco which doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense to me especially in a French restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;3*Salad Nocoise: seared Ahi tuna, egg avocado, pepper, onion. We prefer sliced tune - this version offered a solid brick. Otherwise, the fish was acceptable.",9/29/2021,3

I felt horrible for the waitress because we noticed another table that sent their steak back as well. It was not her fault. It&amp;#39;s very unfortunate because the flavors of the food were good on the salmon, but we were turned off by the fact that they didn&amp;#39;t cook it to our liking.

We split the watermelon/tuna appetizer which was unique and good - we liked the salad that was served with it too. We had a vegan pasta dish which was good but not as memorable as the appetizer - but it&amp;#39;s really nice to see vegan options, especially at a french restaurant!<br&gt;<br&gt;We ended with the peanut butter pie which was delicious.

I didn&amp;#39;t realize it at the time, but everybody around me had the same idea. As I walked in, I noticed that every table inside as well as about half of the tables outside were occupied. The counter attendant took my name and number and I joined the waiting line.<br&gt;<br&gt;Time was involved due to their high volume of work.<br&gt;<br&gt;When it was my turn at the table, he informed me that the indoor tables were all taken but that I could be seated immediately at one of the outdoor tables if I preferred. Feel some remorse because mosquitoes were swarming everywhere.<br&gt;<br&gt;After waiting to be seated in the muggy mosquito-filled air, it seemed like an eternity before my pho finally arrived.<br&gt;<br&gt;It was hard to stop eating the pho. There was plenty of tender beef in a flavorful broth. Though the prices are higher than I&amp;#39;m used to paying for pho, I can see why this place is always packed. It&amp;#39;s also cool that they&amp;#39;re a Boy, Occupation, Gender, and Sexuality (BOYB) establishment.",2/24/2023,5

The food is very good and the service is good...but they are often very busy. They turn out so much takeout that the front door should just be revolving.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance is casual. Menu is great for meat eaters and vegetarians. <br&gt;<br&gt;The set up is not ideal for patrons or servers. The front counter is right in front of the door with seats to the left and right, but all payments and takeout occurs right at that front counter and on say 6pm on a Friday evening it is a bit chaotic - are people waiting to be seated, for pickup, or looking to pay? Who knows? I&amp;#39;d say they have mostly outgrown their location. Would love to see them relocate somewhere close by but with more room and a much better setup.

I always get the 16 with tofu and it never disappoints. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s always really crowded here and there&amp;#39;s limited seating so make sure to come early especially if you have a bigger group.

We were quickly seated after waiting about 10 minutes in line at this popular establishment.

Seating was ample indoors with a large group of people sitting outside as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;Now for the food. For appetizers, we ordered the Chả giò, fried egg rolls with cabbage, pork, and mushrooms. They were great as expected, piping hot and delicious. After that, we tried the Gỏi cuốn Spring rolls with shrimp and veggies. These were very filling and the shrimp tasted super fresh as well but I preferred the Chả giò. <br&gt;<br&gt;The pho itself was PHO-nomenal! (had to do it) The broth was hearty, flavor-filled, steaming hot, and seasoned just right. I had the large Pho Tai Nam with beef, tendon, and meatballs all cooked to perfection. If you love pho, please do yourself a favor and go here, it&amp;#39;s everything you want plus a certain fresh, homemade quality that you don&amp;#39;t get just anywhere. <br&gt;<br&gt;I loved seeing the busy kitchen in view with every stovetop running at full capacity.

But even by a reduced standard, this visit, on 20 NOV 2022, proved quite disappointing.<br&gt;<br&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been looking outside our immediate area  for something new, or at least new to us. The online menu and reviews here had us hopeful. What we found was a menu somewhat smaller than online. Service was fine, the product was horrible, and, in our opinion, drinks were over priced.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the gravy fries and buffalo wings. My partner ordered a flank steak wrap with fries. We ordered around 5:30 pm on this Sunday. There were very few other patrons. The food came out fast. Perhaps too fast, and that should have been a sign.<br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the issues with the product:<br&gt;<br&gt;1) Regardless of the other issues posted here, this was the most telling: both my gravy fries and my partners side of fries were cold. The place was empty. There is no way the kitchen was backed up. And the food came out fast. Like 10 minutes or less fast. This, in and of itself would not be something I would normally even notice (the fries tasted fine, although the gravy was a bit weird, like something from a jar, not heated enough, so it sort of sat atop the pile with a cottage-cheese-ish texture), however the circumstances were such that there is no excuse for them being cold. It was as if they were moved to a refrigerator between the cooking and serving steps. It was really puzzling. If everything else wasn&amp;#39;t inedible, I would have chalked it up to the anomalies of post pandemic life and moved on. I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have even thought about it.<br&gt;<br&gt;2) When the food came, we had no utensils or napkins. The server asked if we wanted anything else. When we indicated that a couple set ups would be nice, she looked at us like we each had 3 heads and placed a stack of napkins on the bar. I said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;d like some silverware for these gravy fries&amp;#39;. She gave me a fork. Only a fork. Apparently they do give a fork. But not two forks.<br&gt;<br&gt;3) The best thing I can say about the wings is that they  were served. The meat had that &amp;#39;gamey&amp;#39;, been in the freezer too long and from a chicken you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to meet in a dark alley taste. This is something I have not tasted since before the pandemic (as that event flushed the supply chain). I willingly ate 2, but when the 3rd was that way also, I gave up on the plate. I&amp;#39;m actually throwing up in my mouth a little but thinking about it as I write this. The sauce was uninspired at best and looked like it was put on by a toddler. Just nothing good about it in either appearance or taste.<br&gt;<br&gt;4) My partners&amp;#39; steak wrap was comprised mostly of arugula. If I had to estimate, there was less than 2 oz of &amp;#39;steak&amp;#39; on it. Surprisingly, I learned that 2oz of steak can really kill a rollup. She took one bite and said &amp;#39;it&amp;#39;s not good&amp;#39;. Since I was just finished wing 1 and not yet ready to form an opinion on anything yet, she borrowed the fork and stabbed a piece of meat out of the rollup and placed it on my plate. This piece was probably 1/4&amp;#34; on the sides and 1&amp;#34; long. I put it in my mouth, and chewed it 10 times. I soon realized I was making no progress. My efforts did not phase it, so I made the executive decision to remove it from my mouth and return it to my plate.  Upon inspection, there was no discernable difference, post maceration, to the &amp;#39;meat&amp;#39;. It could just as easily been a chunk of car tire of that same size. Totally disgusting. <br&gt;<br&gt;Surprise! Surprise! We won&amp;#39;t be back!",11/20/2022,1

Owner was pleasant and offered me a place at the bar or a table. Interior is simple and clean. <br&gt;<br&gt;Started with an Orange Gina mocktail (Orange juice, vanilla, club soda) and was better than I expected. I might start making this at home. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ordered the biscuits and gravy. I&amp;#39;m a big B&amp;amp;G guy, so I tend to be pretty critical.  It came with a side of greens. They happily substituted home-fries for me. <br&gt;The B&amp;amp;G were an elevated and slightly rustic take; very thick and rough chopped onion and sausage throughout. Good flavor and spiced well. The biscuits were grilled, dense, savory, and about a quarter the thickness of a fluffy biscuits. Had to ration the gravy to ensure there was enough for each bite of biscuit; could have used a touch more. As mentioned it seemed they we&amp;#39;re going for an elevated take and they delivered.  Similar to the B&amp;amp;G at Skinny Pancake.  Completely different than, say, Henry&amp;#39;s which is a more plain and simple offering, which certainly has its place. <br&gt;<br&gt;The home fries were quartered round potatoes and seems they were deep fried rather than prepared on a flattop. Regardless, they were wonderfully crispy and seasoned well. I like them crispy so they were a treat for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was good; they checked in on me occasionally to check on the food and check on drinks.  Great experience and I&amp;#39;ll be back to continue my journey with them.",3/5/2022,4

He said, &amp;#34;We should go to Butter&amp;#34; in his dark gravelly voice. At first I was hesitant. I had never heard of Butter in all the 18 years I&amp;#39;ve lived here! But I trusted him. Bernie Sanders&amp;#39; grandson is a reliable source. So it was decided: Butter it was. It was the best decision I have ever made. I ordered the grilled cheese pesto sandwich with tomato and bacon.

We were able to get a reservation same day for 6:45. We started with salads, which were good. I had the roasted root vegetable salad. The greens were fresh, dressing was delicious, and there wasn&amp;#39;t too much of it. The root vegetables were quite under cooked though and didn&amp;#39;t have much flavor. We also had the kale and brussel sprout Caesar salad. That could have used a bit more dressing, and the kale was a bit tough. Perhaps baby kale would have been better, or if they let it sit in the dressing to breakdown the kale. <br&gt;<br&gt; Our main entree was their special for the day, dry aged 14 oz steak to split with scalloped potatoes and roasted asparagus. This was amazing and perfect portions!! The steak had an incredible sear on it and was cooked perfectly for us (although the waitress didn&amp;#39;t ask).

Unfortunately I love ramen and had to try theirs. Honestly it was better than our local sushi/Japanese restaurants&amp;#39; sorry ramen, which is a low bar, but pretty impressive to me for a barbecue place. The broth was just a bit too much for my stomach, almost like a hot and sour soup because of the bbq flavor. I ordered the burnt ends to go with it, and they came in such large pieces they were impossible to eat in the soup- I had to take them out to a separate plate to cut apart. Would&amp;#39;ve loved to try it with their brisket. I think they may be better off without the ramen on the menu but I&amp;#39;m really glad they had something unusual and would like to see if they can improve it. <br&gt;We ordered a jungle party to drink, which tasted really strongly of lime for a pineapple drink. It needed a few stirs. <br&gt;The poutine was immense and satisfying to get some good VT poutine. The pulled pork on top overpowered it for me, but I&amp;#39;m still looking forward to leftovers. <br&gt;The chicken sandwich was five stars. The sauces were each unique and excellent. <br&gt;We did not order our own bbq spread but the bits of meat we tried from our family&amp;#39;s portion were really good.

I expected them to be a bit crispier, but I&amp;#39;m not mad about it because these were otherworldly tender and seasoned beautifully.

And I can say with pretty good certainty that I&amp;#39;ve hit up all the BBQ joints that Definitely will give true BBQ lovers a fantastic meal. I&amp;#39;m fairly confident now that Blue Bird was the last place on my list of NEED TO GO BBQ Spots in New England and I&amp;#39;m so glad I finally did. Atmosphere alone makes this place probably the greatest BBQ spot to check out in New England. The food is amazing, the patio overlooks the river, plenty of options, full bar. The biggest complaint is they only open for dinner 4:30-8:30 Wed-Sat. In Fact we went up for Valentines day in 2021 only to find that they were only doing pre-orders and they were sold out days ago. Not sure if it&amp;#39;s a &amp;#34;we&amp;#39;re too busy thing&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;we don&amp;#39;t want to be that busy&amp;#34; thing. And Covid made them practically close shop forever. But finally I made it and good lord I ordered everything ...<br&gt;<br&gt;Came with sweet pickles ... win<br&gt;<br&gt;Brisket: Cut very precisely, very dark bark but not that thick of a bark, a little cubey which is a little off putting but still looked great. Fat layer was in between the meat, usually I find it right under the bark. Oh My God this was good brisket. Just a teeny bit tough, Bark tasted like it was only the spices that gave it the smokey flavor, no black pepper flavor that I noticed. Moistness was practically perfect, not slimy, not mushy, not greasy wet, just like a nice broth. Fat didn&amp;#39;t melt at all though. I would say the thing that makes this brisket stand out is the texture of the meat. Flavor is great but the texture is really hard to master.<br&gt;<br&gt;Ribs: Came pre cut but in 2s. Sauced but not much, decent meat amount, smoke ring was okay. First bites left me saying &amp;#34;hmm?&amp;#34; the meat tasted charred. Sauce was mapley and it was excellent. That char was really killing it for me. But the tenderness was great, pork meat was smokey, not falling off the bone so cooked well<br&gt;<br&gt;Chicken: Very good smoked chicken, juicy and smokey all trapped under the skin loaded with a great salty smoky almost lemony rub. Flavor of the chicken had almost a buttery sensation to it. Perfect smoked chicken.<br&gt;Mac and Cheese: Looked goopy with some bread crumbs and I hoped it wouldn&amp;#39;t be. Turned out to be cheese goop but tastes way better than other goop I usually get. Mini macaroni, bread crumbs were even good. Not bad<br&gt;<br&gt;Beans: Looked soupy at first, gravy stuck to them though, very red, smelt a chili powder but something sweet too. Had a good garlicky sensation to the smell too. Beans tasted like a sweet and savory mix. I&amp;#39;ll try to explain it as almost a fruity, but tiny kick to it, texture is perfect, and all I want to know is how the hell they made this bean sauce. Amazing beans<br&gt;<br&gt;Cole Slaw: Good thing it wasn&amp;#39;t a completely white hue to it, good mix of colors. Seasonings looked good, no pool of mayo sauce, tasted good but not too traditional, I like the vinegar style. This tasted like mayo with seasoning in it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Roasted Veggies: Like eating a salad that was on fire. No, they were great. Roasted bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, good stuff<br&gt;<br&gt;Mini Cornbread Muffins: Didn&amp;#39;t really look into see if I could just get one so I got the whole dozen of them. Corn meal overload flavor. Flakeyness and Crumbleness made it almost impossible for me. BUT they brought out the maple butter and all was well in the kingdom once more.<br&gt;<br&gt;Apple Hand Pie: Kinda looked like a deep fried taco in cinnamon and maple syrup. This apple hand pie is how you make babies. Insanely good.<br&gt;<br&gt;Banana Jar: Im sure it comes in a mason jar when ordering at dining. Banana pudding is the greatest thing on earth and this recipe is damn near close to the 2nd best I&amp;#39;ve ever had. This was gritty and smooth at the same time. Crust at the bottom was almost like a ginger snap graham cracker crust. Delicious<br&gt;<br&gt;Smores Jar: Marshmallows were toasted on top, a little too crispy for my taste but many other people love that stuff. Pudding was good but didn&amp;#39;t really taste like a homemade batch. Could have been, I don&amp;#39;t know.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sauces: White sauce (Alabama) looked like a south western ranch. Tasted more like a south western ranch too. Carolina one was the most liquidy and a lot more sourness to it, just didn&amp;#39;t taste the sweetness. One of their sauces was a little chunkier than the others, tasted more like a sweet teriyaki bbq sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;Not the best I&amp;#39;ve ever had but definitely up there.

BBQ joints are no exception regardless of TV fame. <br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been to quite a few places that ended up on the DDD line up and its interesting to see what happens after Guy&amp;#39;s anointing. <br&gt;Either the quality and value stay in tact or it diminishes.

Anyone with a Traeger and a select grade of brisket can out perform their flats. <br&gt;$29.50 for a half rack of ribs is outrageous even in this economy/recession. <br&gt;The wings came out as expected but at $2.25 per wing, it&amp;#39;s hardly worth it. <br&gt;The sides were average. <br&gt;I added two orders of the burnt ends that didn&amp;#39;t make it in the bag or the bill. I guess you must be a club card holder to obtain them. <br&gt;Either the bill was taxed at 12% before the service fee of 10%! Yes, a 10% service fee! <br&gt;Or at 9% then later adding the 10% service fee. <br&gt;Either way, you lose totaling an extra $35.59 of no food! <br&gt;This place will survive because it&amp;#39;s in Burlington VT with no competition. Anywhere else it would fail regardless of Flavor Town&amp;#39;s approval.",8/18/2022,1

606,TACO GORDO ,N Winooski Ave,"bars,nightlife,restaurants,taco",1,4.0 ,"Mixed bag here. Visiting Burlington, we had heard good things and read mostly great reviews, so we were excited to try it out. We wanted to try a few different meats so we got 3 different tacos, the carnitas, al pastor, and chicken tinga. The carnitas taco was amazing, al pastor was a close second. Tinga was extremely disappointing, very bland, a little dry. The corn tortillas they use are really good, but I wish they&amp;#39;d use two per taco, not just one. I feel like two tortillas is pretty standard, and also stops the taco from tearing. $5 for one taco is steep for the size of these. They have a topping and salsa bar by the exit/entrance, which is a nice touch if you&amp;#39;re eating there, but to-go they charge for sauces. If I lived in the area, I&amp;#39;d probably go back to try some other options (and have the carnitas again), but if I&amp;#39;m just visiting for a day, maybe tacos just aren&amp;#39;t the move if these are the best in town.",7/7/2022,3

640,PIZZERIA VERITÀ ,Saint Paul St,"cocktailbars,italian,nightlife,pizza,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"This review needs to start with a little about me: I live in the greater New Haven CT area, I built my own brick wood fired pizza oven, and I make Neapolitan style pizza with slow-fermented FWSY dough and fresh ingredients. But I&amp;#39;m visiting in Burlington, where I grew up. And my memory of pizza growing up was, let&amp;#39;s say, not good. Verita caught my eye on a Sunday evening. And it was heaven to find a place where ingredients and methods rise to a high level when no one is watching (literally -- this was Super Bowl Sunday). The Colorata salad combined three kinds of roasted beets, avocado, and a vinaigrette; each beet had a particular flavor to add to the mix. Mmmm. The Capricciosa pizza had an authentic Neapolitan crust,  with aromas more of fermented dough than of yeast. It was nicely blistered, and it was still elastic. The menu advises that the crust turns out a little &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and that it can be made more crispy on request. I&amp;#39;d recommend that for this particular pie, as the heirloom grape tomatoes made the center points a bit soggy and droopy. But this is a quibble. The generous Negroni was a nice prelude to a wonderfully composed dinner.",2/13/2023,5

644,PIZZERIA VERITÀ ,Saint Paul St,"cocktailbars,italian,nightlife,pizza,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"I live next to the building, and have lived there for over 6 months. The restaurant has outdoor speakers that play loud music at night, even past 10PM which is against the local noise ordinances. I contacted them by email over the winter, because their patio was closed and they were still playing the music outside after 10PM, thoughtlessly. Nothing changed. They emailed me back and said they would work on it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Every night it is the same, especially now that their patio is open. Last night the music was on almost all night - I had a fan in my room, my bathroom fan, and ambient music and could still not drown it out. It is seriously effecting my sleep. I&amp;#39;m considering calling the police next time as they are not responsive to email or phone calls.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I am extremely displeased with this establishment, they are not playing the role of a friendly and responsive neighbor business, routinely break the city sound ordinances, and are (in my eyes) a blemish on the downtown business culture. Do not patronize this establishment and convince yourself you are supporting a worthwhile local business.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food is passable, definitely expensive for meals and drinks, overpriced for what is offered in my book.

My hubby and I ended up coming here twice because we enjoyed it so much the first time. The wait staff was great and very attentive (except for refilling water, you have to ask for that mostly but they were down to minimal staff because of the holidays). The space is dark and cozy and makes you want to take your time while you eat. They have beautiful large windows that you can see the NYE fireworks from when they shoot them off (unexpected bonus for us when we booked a reservation for our second meal on NYE). <br&gt;<br&gt;The drinks are great. The maple Manhattan is on point. Spirit-forward and not too sweet. The maple comes from the cherries that are soaked in it so it&amp;#39;s not overwhelming in the drink. I&amp;#39;m not a huge fan of maple but really enjoyed this drink. The pomegranate Paloma was also good but I recommend ordering something with bourbon to fit the mood of the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food was so good. The reason we came here twice was actually because of the wedge salad! A salad of all things! It was the perfect combo of crisp, crunchy iceberg lettuce, amazing homemade ranch dressing, bacon bits, tomatoes, and avocado. What&amp;#39;s not to love? I highly recommend this dish and it was just as good the second night too so it wasn&amp;#39;t a fluke. The cauliflower soup was good but very rich. The lamb pasta was wonderful. The mushroom pasta was good but was nothing compared to the lamb one. I did not like the burrata, but that was just a personal preference. The flavors were good.

I think food itself is somewhere around 3-3.5 star (once again, breakfast only). <br&gt;However, the experience we had there ruined everything. <br&gt;<br&gt;TL;DR: If you or someone in your group has food allergies, save yourself from this place. <br&gt;<br&gt;As a guest of the hotel, I tried to have breakfast there with my family. It wasn&amp;#39;t packed at first but got busier. <br&gt;There was only one server, Daphine, and one very friendly host. I thought that the number of tables were a bit too many for one server to handle. However, it can never justify the server&amp;#39;s attitude nor rudeness. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waiting for her to come was okay and understandable. <br&gt;But when I mentioned food allergy (to specific nuts), she said that &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know it has nuts.&amp;#34;  I did not say nut allergies, I specifically mentioned two nuts, and told her that other nuts are okay and asked her if she could check what kind of nuts are in the granola. She grudgingly said she would do, then walk past us and yelled at someone at kitchen. Well, awkward, but I didn&amp;#39;t realized that that was a cue for us to leave. <br&gt;Later, she came back with our food, and told her that wheat bread or sourdough comes with the omelette, and she said again, &amp;#34;wheat bread has nuts and I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of nuts.&amp;#34; with rudeness. <br&gt;What she should have said, if she or the restaurant truly did not know what kind of nuts in that specific wheat bread, either they don&amp;#39;t know because the supplier did not provide the ingredients (highly doubtful) or she can&amp;#39;t figure it out because there is no one to ask at the moment. Rather than plainly rude, she could have tried to acknowledge the situation. <br&gt;By then, we were very uncomfortable and and had to leave without finishing our meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;Have you ever imagined that someone has a disability and he/she got denied (I don&amp;#39;t care, I don&amp;#39;t need to spare one more minutes to accommodate your disability) at a hotel restaurant? I have not. But I experienced it. My family member has food allergies and it is indeed a disability under ADA. It was a passive aggressive discrimination. <br&gt;<br&gt;She might be too busy to cover all the tables by herself, but that does not justify her attitude. <br&gt;<br&gt;We are staying 5 more days and will come back this fall, but we will never come back to here.

The one main disappointment was that I ordered pancakes $12 and asked for a side of two eggs scrambled and they charged me $13 for the two egg entree minus all the meats and toast. So pancakes and two eggs was $25. Not happy. They should have told me it will be entree price for two eggs or they should&amp;#39;ve charged me for only the eggs, say $6 extra. Still the same meal at an IHOP or Denny&amp;#39;s would&amp;#39;ve been $7-$8. Service was very good and place is very nice. Won&amp;#39;t eat there again.",6/6/2021,3

Ordered a quinoa mushroom dish. Came like soup. Very unappealing. Ordered the $20 burger came like a hockey  puck despite ordering medium. Fries good! Ordered steak came with fries. Strange but good. No other option offered. Ordered chicken tenders and fries fir a very picky 8 year old and received some very fancy chicken meal he wouldn&amp;#39;t touch waiter informed didn&amp;#39;t seem apologetic at all huffy about taking it away. We had been very clear when ordering I think he can&amp;#39;t hear! Ordered flatbread with cheese honey pie but dip was excellent dip bread totally burned. Ordered Brussels sprouts also very burned. When clearing plates a blond haired middle age lady asked if we were doing ok and seemed to want to hurry to clear plates. We said we were not great and didn&amp;#39;t care much  for food all she said was ok cleared and left no inquiry. Told waiter about all burned and overdone food nothing was done.

682,BLEU NORTHEAST KITCHEN ,Cherry St,"breakfast_brunch,restaurants,sandwiches,seafoo",3,4.0 ,"I called up for seats for first service thinking since it&amp;#39;s Super Bowl Weekend it might be &amp;#34;Fully Committed&amp;#34; to my delight the young lady who answered the phone could not have been nicer and gave us a table right away. I&amp;#39;ve heard about Bleu from a fellow chef and of their philosophy of attaining locally sourced produce. So I was excited to try them out and to try out their extensive fish options. <br&gt;Bleu is situated within the Hotel Vermont therefor the decor is a bit corporate but with that being said i was pleasantly surprised to see well placed noise reduction panels on the ceiling and noise reduction materials within the main room. High ceilings and large windows allow for a non cluttered space. We were immediately attended to by our server Ryan. He could not have been any more nicer, more professional, more knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list. We requested a coursed out meal which was not an issue and we were off to the races. <br&gt;Our first course was a dozen Washington based oysters which were fresh briny and perfectly shucked. We paired this with a  crisp, dry Le Berceau Brut from Limoux, France. The second course was the Burrata with roasted carrots, kale-pepita pesto, cranberry preserve on a toasted brioche. This was a flavorful dish with a lot going on. Maybe a bit too much. The burrata was creamy with crisp sides but the cranberry preserve was an odd pairing flavor profile with the roasted carrots and the pesto. Our third course was their signature Pan-Seared Scallops with roasted cauliflower, pomegranate molasses drizzle, and pistachios. This was indeed the star plate of the evening. Our scallops were expertly seared with a nice &amp;#34;chef touch&amp;#34; of cross hatching. The cauliflowers were not dried out with a nice crunch. The real surprise was the base of the dish. A puree of sunchokes. It was so creamy it was sublime. We almost ordered a second round!! <br&gt;Our fourth course was the Pan-Seared Jonah Crab Cake, with onion confit, pickled red onions, black garlic aioli. This was paired with a Steele Chardonnay from sonoma that was perfect. The crab cake was well constructed without too many fillers and seasoned correctly. The Black garlic aioli appeared to be an after thought on the plate presented as a lightly smeared streak. I would of liked a heavier application to accompany the crab cake. The two pearl onions were to have been confit,  but I think they missed the mark. Overall that dish was good but unfortunately did not reach the same level as our other courses. We finished our meal with a chocolate hazelnut cake with ganache and candied cocoa nibs, and whipped cream. The cake was moist and not too sweet, the whipped cream was a bit flat. Our waiter Ryan made this evening with his accommodations to our requests. Our overall experience was one of fulfillment, joy and satisfaction. I would recommend Bleu and will return again. <br&gt;Easy parking which is generously validated. Noise level moderate. Live music was a bonus. Although we did not sit at the bar after or before dinner, their bar menu looked worthy of a sit down.",2/2/2020,5

My sister ordered the halibut which she raved about, and her boyfriend had the chicken roulade which he enjoyed as well. Unfortunately my mom and I were left rather disappointed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the salmon (which was nearly $40 - quite steep for farm raised salmon). The salmon had nice flavor but it was overcooked slightly, the portion was skimpy (for roughly $40 that is unacceptable), and the risotto was bland as can be. My mother had  an appetizer salad and charcuterie board for her dinner, both of which she said were unsatisfying and not worthy of the high prices.",10/16/2019,3

The meat was sourced from high quality New England farms and the taste shines through. I had the NY strip and it was the best NY strip I&amp;#39;ve ever had. I ordered the steak medium rare and it was more of a medium but I was okay with that. My MIL ordered the chicken which was sourced from Misty Knoll&amp;#39;s farm. I am not a fan of chicken but Misty Knolls is a great chicken farm. 100% certified humane, high quality meat. Staff was knowledgeable and kind. Maple creme brûlée finished our dinner and it was quite large and very creamy. Maple was not screaming at you but rounded the custard flavor.

For appetizers we each had Caesar salads (hold the anchovies), which were grilled. Not awful, but I&amp;#39;ve had much better Caesar salads at our local take-out pizza joint.

I was excited where I was headed. Round two were the scallop appetizer. I found them to be bland, flavorless and a bit undercooked. Next up, the Blue &amp;amp; Greens salad, how do you mess up blue cheese and bacon? They did. Greens were wilted like they sat under a heat lamp, bacon was underdone and blue cheese, well, extremely average. Pass! Next up, $38 halibut dish. The foul smell arrived before the dish, halibut so over cooked it was hard to cut, seriously. I think it was over cooked to cover the fact it should&amp;#39;ve been tossed. Waitress agreed it didn&amp;#39;t look or smell &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; so she swapped for the mushroom Papparadelle Pasta. Slimy, massive oily mess and the shrimp? I&amp;#39;ve included a picture.

690,CAFE DIM SUM ,St Paul St,"dimsum,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"UPDATE December 2022: we have had the good fortune to have the hotpot / shabu shabu with Chef Sam and friends. The cuisine has a foundation of Chinese hot pot ingredients and Japanese style shabu shabu ingredients like udon and fish cakes. This is a dining experience that takes 1.5- 2.5 hours to enjoy as you are cooking your meat, vegetables and noodles with a broth during the meal. A good date or small party with friends kind of meal. The broth arrives warm with herbs and shittake mushrooms and placed in an individual convection burners in the table.<br&gt;<br&gt;You order your meat platter: chicken, pork (shoulder, belly), prime rib, or seafood. It comes with vegetables. You can add extras to cook in your soup. I love the soybean skin plus the handmade dumplings (with a choice of different fillings). I also like the fried taro cake in the broth. You can make your own sauce base at the sauce bar and then add the special House sauce to dip your cooked ingredients. Over time your broth gets thick and you&amp;#39;ll need more water added to keep cooking your food. Be prepared to bring home your broth and any extra ingredients. It makes for a tasty second meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;Written early November 2022:<br&gt;The newly expanded Cafe Dim Sum is great and the new system for ordering at the counter and getting dim sum from steamer and warming shelf are delicious as when they opened a year ago.  Dim sum offers a lot of great steamed dishes, but the chef offers fried foods for those who are use to Americanized Chinese and are open to trying dishes that are unfamiliar to their palette. Please keep an open mind to eating these dim sum dishes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Written in February 2022: I go to Cafe Dim Sum regularly and really appreciate the work that Chef Sam Lian does making each dish by hand. He goes through great lengths to bring quality Asian ingredients from NYC and Boston, which many places in Burlington have to do and reflected in pricing.  If you have not eaten dim sum before, please leave your preconceived notions of Chinese food (American Chinese food is different tasting than authentic regional Chinese cuisine) at the door and be open to trying these small dishes packed with flavor and drink it with tea (they have some great teas...I like the chrysanthemum).<br&gt;<br&gt;We are so happy to see a dim sum spot open in Burlington. The dim sum has many Cantonese favorites of ours including har gow (shrimp dumpling), Lo mai gai (chicken sticky rice with Chinese sausage, wrapped in tea leaf), fried sesame ball, turnip cake, ha cheung (shrimp wrapped in rice noodle), fried turnip cake, egg tart, and tripe.  The food came out promptly once ordered at the register and was served hot. They had a good choice of teas to have with the meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;The staff are nice. The cafe has a few tables, but be patient as folks will finish up and a table will open momentarily.<br&gt;<br&gt;For those of us, who missed having dim sum in big cities especially Montreal, this cafe provides a taste of the familiar and is authentic dim sum.",11/30/2022,5

Let<br&gt;Me start by saying I love Dim Sum in all forms so I was stoked to find a dim sum restaurant while working in VT. <br&gt;<br&gt;Cafe Dim Sum is in the heart of downtown Burlington a block or sat away from the the iconic Church Street. They off a wide variety of dishes that continuously being added to the safe up front so they might be out of the dish you want but grab a few others snack while you wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ordering is a little unusual but makes sands as you understand the concept. Dishes fall in a category of A,BC,D,E with A being the cheapest and E the most expensive ($7 I believe) as you order dishes from the case they make a mark on your ticket and the total is added up when your done. <br&gt;<br&gt;We had about 6 different dishes but the seafood sticky rice and the steaks pork buns were my favorites",11/10/2022,5

I&amp;#39;ve had dinner there three times in the past 6 days. I don&amp;#39;t know how I will get through the dumpling lust that awaits me for the short time they are closed. The closest places with anything comparable are Montreal and Boston china towns.<br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s often a wait but it&amp;#39;s more than worth it - St. Paul St has fantastic bars so we usually go to mad river distillers, monarch, 126, or drink while we wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you love dim sum, you will not be disappointed! If you&amp;#39;re new to dim sum, you will not be disappointed! There is something for everyone here. <br&gt;<br&gt;Love the prices, five people eating to their fullest was about $32 each including tip. Get to try 10+ different foods when down the street you&amp;#39;d get one entree and a cheap drink for that same price. Going in a group is so fun because you get to try lots of things! <br&gt;<br&gt;Personal favorites -<br&gt;The baby bok choy is tender and delicious and complements the heavier dishes. <br&gt;The steamed custard bun is heavenly, not too sweet and so fluffy. <br&gt;The turnip cakes are a classic. Always my fave when I was growing up eating dim sum and this one does not disappoint.<br&gt;The fried sticky rice with mushrooms and Chinese sausage is just fantastic. <br&gt;The scallion pancakes are a hit with everyone I&amp;#39;ve been there with. Perfectly crispy. Good sized portion and great as leftovers - whether heated up in the toaster oven or cold at 1 am. <br&gt;<br&gt;Other great dishes: <br&gt;All of their teas are lovely but the chrysanthemum is very nice and so pretty when the flowers rehydrate, har gow(shrimp dumpling), sesame balls, fried taro cake, steamed shrimp rice roll, crispy veggie rolls, cheese wonton, potstickers, honey roast pork bun, char siu bao.

701,CAFE DIM SUM ,St Paul St,"dimsum,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"Cute place and like another yelped mentioned it&amp;#39;s not your usual dim sum.  When you score a table you essentially get back up once you&amp;#39;ve put in your drink order (tea, water, soda).  You go up to the counter where there&amp;#39;s a display case of all the different kinds of dim sum you may want.  Notably missing where the har gow and flat rice noodles that are usually wrapped w/shrimp. The sui mai was not as expected given that they essentially made the filling like a puréed meat dumpling.  Think shrimp toast consistency.  I did like the individually wrapped sticky rice but it was like a small brownie size.  Maybe 3 bites and that yummy goodness is a goner. So losing stars in taste as the majority of it was bland, no har gow and the dining room is definitely not suitable for Vermont winters.  Everytime the door open the entire place felt the chill.  On the upside the eggplant and banana leaf sticky rice were the most flavorful items.  Definitely worth the visit if you want dim sum n can&amp;#39;t get to Chinatown in NYC or Canada.  But you won&amp;#39;t get the main staples ... while sui mai is on the menu as previously mentioned it&amp;#39;s not the norm.",12/4/2022,3

717,CAFE DIM SUM ,St Paul St,"dimsum,restaurant",2,4.5 ,"I wanted to like this place and given that there&amp;#39;s no other dim sum restaurant in VT, was excited to try it out.  It was just OK and nowhere near what you would get in Boston or Montreal.  The portions were smaller, price points higher (understandable given it&amp;#39;s VT) and either lacking in flavor or the flavors were completely off.  We tried several dishes.  The eggplant and chicken feet dishes were the best tasting of the bunch, the shrimp dumpling (har gow) were acceptable.  The turnip cake and shrimp rice noodle rolls were super disappointing (both flavors and textures).  For anyone who has had dim sum before, this place will not compare.  I will say that it&amp;#39;s nice to have this option in Burlington though and for dim sum first timers, this is a good introduction.",11/21/2021,3

The duck ragout was full of flavors and the sauce was on point. We also really appreciated having gluten-free options since one of us has a gluten intolerance. <br&gt;<br&gt;We wrapped up our experience at Bourbon Street by ordering the sweet potato maple cheesecake, which was absolutely amazing and so unique.

The catfish had a well-seasoned, peppery outside with an incredibly tender, perfectly cooked texture. It came with red beans and rice, collard greens, and was topped with a pineapple salsa. All of these perfectly complemented the flavor of the fish. The pineapple salsa was bright and sweet to go with the peppery fish. The red beans and rice and collard greens were mellow and savory.<br&gt;<br&gt;The owner is also the chef, the waiter, and the dishwasher and is absolutely amazing.

Every meal that we had in this restaurant was delicious, and we tried quite a few. Even the house red wine, which was made from grapes grown in Turkey, was silky and bone-dry.<br&gt;<br&gt;The meze starter is an absolute requirement. We&amp;#39;ve eaten better hummus, but this is up there with the best of it. It&amp;#39;s really chunky and quite fresh. An incredible assortment of spices may be found in the packed grape leaves. The babaganoush has just the right amount of smokiness. The other pepper sample has a robust amount of heat, while the yogurt has a thick and sour flavor.<br&gt;<br&gt;My husband particularly like the mixed kebabs, which are served with some of the finest rice we&amp;#39;ve ever had. Their cup of cucumber soup is something I could look forward to eating every day. It&amp;#39;s basically yogurt sauce, which is one of those things of which I can never have too much. Another one of our favorites is lentil soup. Our children enjoy the hummus and rice and kabobs more than the cheese pizza that is offered on the children&amp;#39;s menu, despite the fact that this menu does provide a cheese pizza.<br&gt;<br&gt;To my astonishment, the second level is much larger than I expected, and the building even has a rooftop patio.

My zucchini fritter was fried to a gorgeous golden color, but it was totally absent of salt or seasoning, despite containing parsley, dill, and Turkish herbs. The yogurt sauce was acidic, but had nothing to work against in the fritter, so it was really not in balance. My chicken shish wrap needed to be marinated longer - it didn&amp;#39;t have much marinade, nor was it juicy - and the thick lavash wrap, folded tightly against itself, needed more flavor to feel worth the calories. <br&gt;<br&gt;The outdoor dining area and storefront are charming, but I&amp;#39;d go looking elsewhere the next time I wanted Turkish food.",9/9/2022,3

Takeout order so I did not realize the incorrect order until I was home.  When I called them that same night to let them know of their mistake they argued with me that I ordered the won&amp;#39;t thing.  Even though the person I spoke with initially was a man and this was a woman.  She then said I could come the next day to get the tiger  rolls and when I called the next day she said she meant that I was ok to order and pay for them but didn&amp;#39;t mean they would be free since I didn&amp;#39;t get them the night before.  She also said she &amp;#34;hope for all of their food to be edible&amp;#34; a very low standard as a restaurant should aim for better than edible.

The food here was so good and different from anything else around. It is on the smaller side and some of it (beverage station) is self-serve so you do have to get up and down a bit.<br&gt;<br&gt;We tried the Deja vu crepe and the veggie pesto crepe - the pesto was my favorite but both were good.

Once it was settled that there was space for us she told us we could go have a seat at the bar. Upon arrival to the bar, someone asked if the hostess had sent us over, to which we replied yes. Then after 30 minutes of not being spoken to, listening to the waitress ask the hostess to come over to fix her bra strap, and a couple at the bar leaving without ordering, another patron sat next to us with a menu. The bar staff overheard us ask her where she got the menu. The staff then asked the hostess to bring us over a set of menus and asked if we had spoke to the hostess again... to which we again replied yes. It was then an additional 20 minutes when we figured out on our own that we had to walk 3 feet around the corner of the bar to the computer to order our drinks and food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I can&amp;#39;t deny the food was delicious and the single bartender who made all of the espresso drinks and alcoholic beverages for the sold out Sunday  brunch hour was a star, but we left feeling the food could not make up for the complete breakdown in communication and hospitality of the front line staff.

We even tried to make reservations before we came and all options were unavailable. We experimented with the site and tried to book out two months in advance and reservations were unavailable, making me think that this might be a dated feature. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were quoted and hour and were seated at an hour and 45. We very quickly realized the most likely reason that the wait is so long is due to the fact that the restaurant is semi-service. You&amp;#39;re seated, allowed time to look at the menu, and then go up to a counter to order and the food is delivered.<br&gt;<br&gt;We ended up ordering and I ordered a vanilla latte, the blueberry frumplecake, the poutine, and then a seasonal menu special that had pears, goat cheese, and chicken. The first thing that arrive was the coffee. When it was set on the table I noticed that there is not sugar on the table. <br&gt;<br&gt;You have to walk to the front of the restaurant to a small enclave, where there is a water station and a coffee station, similar to Starbucks. It was a little awkward going all the way to the front from where we were to fix the coffee and also every time we needed a refill. <br&gt;<br&gt;When the food arrived I tried the poutine and it was really good. The curds were properly melted while still retaining shape and also being completely gooey at the same time and the gravy was really great as well. <br&gt;<br&gt;The frumplecake was also pretty good, but the blueberry compote was quite tart, only salvaged by the whipped cream on the plate. It was have been amazing if the compote was sweeter as the cake itself was perfectly made. <br&gt;<br&gt;As for the special, the first few bites of the pear, balsamic, and goat cheese were delicious, but once I bit into a piece of chicken it was very off putting and did not marry well with the rest of the ingredients at all. <br&gt;<br&gt;Vanilla Latte: 3/5<br&gt;Blueberry Frumplecake: 2/5<br&gt;Poutine: 4/5 <br&gt;Seasonal Crepe: 1/5",11/10/2022,3

Thankfully before she could seat us, the actual person working as the host arrived and he was amazing at his job.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food itself was nothing to write home about other than to warn your family to find somewhere else.

Got the breakfast monster. Added sausage since it comes meatless otherwise. Excellent flavors. Melts in your mouth. Will order again. Also got the special peppermint crepe to satisfy the sweet tooth. Not a big fan. The fruit spread they added overpowered the peppermint to the point the peppermint was hardly detectable. The choco monkey, nutella and banana, would have probably been a much better choice. Regardless, ate every last bite of it. Help-yourself coffee bar was well stocked with good coffee. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, worth battling the elements for a good meal. Officially added to the rotation. Glad I went.",12/12/2022,5

We waited in line for about 45 minutes while a single host ferried groups of people to tables inside and outside. Watching him lackadaisically wander around the patio and in-and-out of the building made my husband and I wonder if he was a) new, b) employing some kind of stall tactic so as not to overload the kitchen, or c) just plain spacing out. A couple of times during our wait, other Staff would approach the host stand with a stack of menus and a smile, quick to add, &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m not the host, but he&amp;#39;ll be right back.&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;Once we were greeted by said Host, we opted for an Indoor table only to be shocked by how many empty tables we saw upon entering the building. We seriously had our choice of all but one or two occupied tables. Once seated, we then STOOD IN LINE AGAIN to order our food -- this time, about a 20-minute wait! Our order was taken by a single staff member (who also doubled as an assistant to the Bartender??) at a single computer terminal; we were given our &amp;#34;bottomless coffee cups&amp;#34; to fill at-will at the drink station, and then we went back to our table to await the arrival of breakfast.<br&gt;<br&gt;Once delivered, the food looked presentable, appetizing, and was warm -- all good things! The &amp;#34;Noah&amp;#39;s Ark&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Breakfast Monster&amp;#34; were particularly delicious; the bacon was crisp; the crepes were just the right amount of chewy -- again, all good things!<br&gt;<br&gt;However, at one point, we asked a &amp;#34;Server/Runner&amp;#34; to clear a plate from our overcrowded high-top table (after she had just deliveredfood to another table, her hands were empty, and she was on her way back to the kitchen-area), and her response was, &amp;#34;Oh, just leave it there, and we&amp;#39;ll clear it off when you&amp;#39;re done.&amp;#34; Seriously??? So we just stacked our dirty plates underneath/around the plate of food from which we were still eating...but we shouldn&amp;#39;t have needed to.<br&gt;<br&gt;As my husband and I left, most tables inside and about half the tables outside were empty (still/again), and we shook our heads as we passed a line at the Host Stand more than 20-people deep. By this point, it was nearing 10:00. Why the wait?? What&amp;#39;s the hold-up??<br&gt;<br&gt;Bottom line, The Skinny Pancake has good food -- I&amp;#39;m glad we tried it while we were visiting Burlington. Would I wait in line to eat here again? Probably not. This place should strongly reconsider its approach to efficiency and customer service!! Maybe seated patrons would be less aggravated than those standing in a line staring at empty tables...? Maybe scanning a QR Code to order food from the comfort of one&amp;#39;s table would be preferable over milling through a deli-style line...? I guess it almost doesn&amp;#39;t matter, considering this place seems busy most of the time. But potential-patron, consider yourself warned!!",8/6/2022,2

The chicken and crumpled crepe was delicious and all of the desert themed crepes we got were yummy as well. The basic breakfast with eggs and bacon was okay, but again that&amp;#39;s not really what they&amp;#39;re known for. Stop in just for dessert or for an entire meal.

We figured, it must be a staple, why not try it out?<br&gt;<br&gt;We get put on a waiting list and not 15 minutes later, we&amp;#39;re called to our table. I ordered the breakfast monster crepe and a glass of cool cider. The cider is good, full of apple flavor. The crepe is good too, you would have never guessed a combo of pesto, squash, spinach and eggs would be good, but it is! The crepe too has a nice sweetness to it. <br&gt;<br&gt;But it didn&amp;#39;t really wow me like other crepe places I&amp;#39;ve tried. And really the reason I&amp;#39;m docking a star, is the silverware. It was like elfenware. Beautiful yes, but it was so smooth my hands kept slipping when trying to cut. And the knife that was given had no serrated edge so it took me a while to pierce and tear through the crepe layers...<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I think it still warrants a visit based on the other reviews.

A lot of the menu items are really reasonably priced, so you can definitely order a couple things to try, though the portions are pretty large. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Breakfast Burrito - Good on flavor, with beans most prominent throughout. This went well with the sour cream and hot sauce provided. I would definitely order this again -- a good choice for breakfast <br&gt;<br&gt;- Sugarshake Crepe - A very light treat after breakfast. I enjoyed it very much. There was a light maple syrup sauce inside. For $5, you get a nice portion -- a really great value in my opinion. <br&gt;<br&gt;- Choco Monkey Crepe - You get a really good portion for the price.

Once you&amp;#39;ve ordered they give you a number for your table and then bring the food out to you when it&amp;#39;s ready. <br&gt;<br&gt;Getting a table outside can be tricky on a nice day but if you&amp;#39;re patient and you wait around a bit, they open up!

I enjoyed it! We also ordered fries to share and they were the good kind of fries where they were nice and crunchy! <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, we had to finish our lunch with a little creemee dessert!

If I had to nitpick, it tasted a little too mapley (more artificial than the real maple-syrup creemees I&amp;#39;m used to), but on a hot day, I wasn&amp;#39;t complaining. My husband&amp;#39;s chocolate milkshake was just okay. We expected it to be thicker than it was, but it did the trick.

890,BURLINGTON BAY MARKET & CAFE ,Battery St,"beer_and_wine,burgers,food,restaurants,tradamerica",1,4.0 ,"I&amp;#39;m starting to warm up to this place every time that I stop in here for a good lunch. The benefits of eating here are obvious- you have some of the best views of Lake Champlain &amp;amp; the Burlington waterfront, good customer service, and pretty decent food. <br&gt;<br&gt;The downside? Not too much. The food can be somewhat pricey on particular items, yet reasonable on some. You&amp;#39;ll see the mark ups on basic food staples almost right away. For lunch, I chose a crab cake sandwich with local 6% IPA brew for just over $14. What did the sandwich come with? NOTHING. No sides whatsoever. C&amp;#39;mon now, Burlington Bay Market &amp;amp; Cafe! At least add a side of something rather than have your customers pay for an additional add-on. That could be money spent on....yet another local beer! For the first-time visitors to Burlington, the beer in town is really, really good, FYI.<br&gt;<br&gt;I wound up wanting more food, of which I chose a small cup of chowder. And of course, another IPA, which ultimately came out to about a $29-30 lunch. I was more bent from the alcohol than hungry, yet there was no way that I was going to walk down the street to Creemee&amp;#39;s and get a cone to satisfy my hunger, let alone cross the street to get a few crepes from the pancake place. Just a bit disappointing, overall.<br&gt;<br&gt;BTW, I&amp;#39;ve purchased maple syrup from here, and its a bit overpriced. For the bigger bottle (a pint), its $24.95. Pah-lease! Talk about price mark up. You can order the same bottle on Amazon for much less. Yet it was from Vermont, and the local syrup is just like the beer- phenomenal. The parking out front is stupid limited on space, so its better to park in the back and just walk up the steps. If you are lucky, you&amp;#39;ll find a space. Otherwise, its either limited street parking, or at the pay-to-park lot a stone&amp;#39;s throw away. I think that its between $5-10 to park within that lot.<br&gt;<br&gt;Altogether, not a bad place to enjoy the views of the Burlington waterfront, and eat lightly (as opposed to heartily).",9/18/2018,3

After not being able to contact the restaurant due to their phone being busy for 20 minutes, I decided to drive there to see what was going on with my order. Upon arrival, I was told they were over an hour and a half behind schedule and if I wanted to cancel they understood. After some back-and-forth, they agreed to expedite my order since I was there and I finally walked out with my food at 8:35pm. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing - the food was all amazing, if not excellent. The Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Tom Kah, chive dumplings, and pot stickers with coconut curry sauce were all excellent. In fact, it&amp;#39;s the best Thai food I&amp;#39;ve had since leaving Pittsburgh (PA) and Durham/Chapel Hill (NC)... and I live in Boston currently. It wasn&amp;#39;t greasy, it was just the perfect level of spice, and the portion size was fantastic for the value. I&amp;#39;ve had mediocre Thai food before, and this was far and above that line - probably landing in the top 10 experiences I&amp;#39;ve had (and this was takeout, not even dine-in). However, the overall experience really left a bad taste in my mouth (and it had nothing to do with the food). <br&gt;<br&gt;In fairness to the restaurant and hostess who had to deal with me, the food was fantastic (once we got it) and she was very apologetic and polite throughout the process. I was given a glass of water to wait at the bar/pick-up area for the about 40 minutes I was there. We were comped an order of pot stickers and dumplings for the over an hour wait, which was greatly appreciated and had the delivery and other fees removed plus a discount for the inconvenience. <br&gt;<br&gt;It really is a shame I had such a bad experience with the takeout/pickup experience, as the food we ordered (and were comped) was fantastic. However, being that late with a known delay and no communication is unacceptable in the connected nature of the world that we live in. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would give this place another chance when we return to Burlington to see if this was a one-off issue with service and takeout. I hope to be able to adjust my rating the next time we are in town and they are not under such stress and duress during a holiday. I wanted to give a higher rating, but in the end given all the different outs that could have happened (and I&amp;#39;ve experienced) - it was just not in the cards.

914,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"Because they are family run, really accommodating, decorated nicely and chock full of creativity in an alley space, they are awesome!  The menu is fun and different, as most places where I have Thai food there is no such extensive drink menu, and the music is also boring.  It probably helps that one of the family members knows his music to be on the more modern, hipster side of livening things up with tunes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyhow, as for the seating, you can sit inside, somewhat inside in a covered patio like area or outside, in the alley.  The alley seating can be fun to see all the people walking around near the alley in the Church St area and/or just settling down into one of the nearby eateries, where there is live music on the weekends.  The decor is fun and fresh, modern and inviting.  I liked it a lot when walking in and appreciated it while dining.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is not overwhelming, but it is fair.  It has classics like pad Thai and curry dishes, fried rice, pad kee mao, as well as specials that revolve around seafood and poultry.  They have an extensive appetizer selection, though, which I found impressive.  I enjoyed sampling the veg spring rolls and chive dumplings, though I was surprised they were deep fried wedges of what seem like a mix between the concept of dim sum turnip cake consistency and deep fried tofu in the triangular shape.  I would&amp;#39;ve liked some dipping sauce (peanut?) for the spring rolls, but that&amp;#39;s just because I like peanut dipping sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;I like ordering many dishes rather than just one dish, so I opted for some salads, like the som tum and rocket + avocado.  The avocado was very generous, and I was very happy.  The papaya salad was fresh and not overwhelmingly spicy, but it definitely had a kick that made me unable to eat it inhalation style - slow consumption was best.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Then, of course, no good Thai food experience is complete without sticky rice-  I opted for mine in the sweet version with mango.  Wow, this was literally the largest portion of mango with sticky rice I&amp;#39;ve ever had at a restaurant, ever.  I feel like it was an entire large mango, which pretty much NEVER happens.  It was perfectly sweetened and ripened!  The sticky rice was also twice the serving of any place I&amp;#39;ve had sticky rice dessert!  So, it just made me happier (and fatter).<br&gt;<br&gt;They have a specials board, so just ask.  They&amp;#39;re very accommodating for dietary needs, as well, but just emphasize its importance.  They have homemade ice cream in the summer, at least, made of coconut and mango.  Yum!  The portions, again, wow - if you just had dinner, there&amp;#39;s low probability you could eat the whole dish and not feel extra bloated.<br&gt;<br&gt;If I feel like Thai in Burlington, I wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate to go back.",8/13/2019,4
915,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"The food and drinks were excellent. Unfortunately, that was overshadowed by the poor service. Our reservation was for 6:30 outdoors on patio. We received our drinks about 7:00 then nothing else until almost 8:00. We asked the server twice to check on our food as several tables had come after us and were already done their dinner.  There was never an apology or even coming to the table to update us on our order. Finally, some of our food was served but others in our party were not served until some of us had finished eating. The food was good enough to get take out but will not go back due to the service.",8/30/2022,2

917,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"Pretty disappointed, have been to this place a few times in the past year and it has gone downhill. I tried to make a reservation online for 5 people and got an error message saying they weren&amp;#39;t accepting online reservations anymore. It said to call them and make a reservation, so I tried calling and never got an answer. I called 5 times and nobody ever picked up. Went in later and there was no hostess, waited in the doorway for 5+ minutes before anyone even looked our way. Waited half an hour to be seated which was understandable since it was a friday night. Ordered food and it was pretty good but not as great as I remembered. Certainly not close to the best Thai food I&amp;#39;ve had, but this is Vermont. The service was not good, our server never came back to check on us and it seemed like the whole staff was more interested in talking to each other at the bar than taking care of customers. There was a 4% service fee for using a card, wtf? On top of that, they do an automatic gratuity :/ I think it was 16 or 17%. The service was so bad I would never have left that much for a tip. It really sucks cause I used to like this place a lot but totally not worth it anymore",12/5/2022,2
918,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"Literally in the alley downtown Burlington, this Thai food is to die for. I was craving Thai all week and finally made it in. Primarily a late night dinner spot, especially for drinks. I was lucky to get a reservation and table earlier on with a friend at 5:30. Excellent service. Great vibe. Loud music, but it gets you in the mood. Dark atmosphere with lights. Smaller place, cosy feel. <br&gt;Mao Ping Sushi, delicious meat, almost like teriyaki, on a bed of sushi rice. Great appetizer. <br&gt;Pad Thai very big portion. Exactly what I was expecting. <br&gt;Drunken Noodles were delicious. Not too spicy, pretty sweet actually. Perfect portion to fill you up. Cooked super well. <br&gt;Thai iced tea, pretty sweet, but great.<br&gt;Definitely will come back. Especially after I turn 21",3/14/2021,5
919,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"We rarely encountered such poor service.  Just awful!<br&gt;<br&gt;We were at one of the outdoor tables and no one paid attention to us.  I had to stop a server to let her know that we were more than ready to order drinks and food.  It took a while for the red wine to arrive.  The wine glass was so dirty that we had to send it back.  35 minutes later, we were still waiting for the food, feeling very hungry.  We complained to two different servers about it.  The responses were similar: &amp;#34;The restaurant had to take care of take-out orders, indoor customers, and other outdoor customers blah blah blah, and it took time....blah blah blah &amp;#34;  And we were told to wait for another 15 minutes.  Seriously?  We ordered two very simple dishes: Pad See Ew &amp;amp; Red Curry.  50 minutes to prepare two simple dishes is outrageous. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have the capacity to handle all the orders, then don&amp;#39;t accept so many orders. Don&amp;#39;t allow so many customers to come in.  You can&amp;#39;t run a restaurant and expect your customers to wait for almost an hour for a simple dish.  The worst part?  They don&amp;#39;t even apologize for such poor service. Instead, they give lame excuses.",8/18/2021,1
920,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"Wonderful food and atmosphere, very friendly staff. Highly recommend the pot stickers and the home made dumplings, and for the entree split the Thai International and/or the Happy Boat.(That&amp;#39;s what I order for to go before I came back 2 days later)<br&gt;<br&gt;Now this place is technically a hidden gem. Its hidden in a back alley literally. But for starters you should try shrimp green curry, that was amazing. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce was delicious with just the right amount of heat. The chive dumplings were so good, and gluten free! The rocket and avocado salad was huge and had decent portions of avocado and cashews with a mouth watering dressing.

924,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"Don&amp;#39;t even bother. Partner and I really loved this restaurant the first few times we came, but have had horrible service and wait times the past two visits. A few weeks back we made a reservation and were seated right away, but our server walked away and didn&amp;#39;t come back for 20+ minutes. We weren&amp;#39;t able to order drinks, apps, or mains during that time and had to track down another server to get ahold of ours. Waited a very long time for food to come and were disappointed when the apps and mains finally arrived at the same time. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our most recent experience was worse. We arrived at 8:20 and didn&amp;#39;t receive our main dishes until roughly 10:00. We had to ask multiple times for our food, silverware, etc. and had four separate servers &amp;#34;attend&amp;#34; to our table throughout the night. While we waited, we saw several other parties who arrived after us receive their food and leave long before our meals came. My party let the waitstaff know how unhappy we were and they said they prioritize parties with reservation ahead of walk-ins. However, our last experience as guests who had a reservation does not back up that statement.<br&gt;Unfortunately we will not be returning because the food is just too expensive to justify the truly awful service. If you eat here, be prepared to wait at least an hour to get your food know that you&amp;#39;ll practically have to get out of your seat just to catch the attention of the wait staff. There are about 20 excellent restaurants around the corner, save yourself and pick one of those instead.",3/19/2022,1

If you don&amp;#39;t see anything you like they can always make whatever you want on their menu. I&amp;#39;m really glad I took a chance on this place because the quality of their fish far exceeded my expectations. I would, however,  have liked to see more variety of fish/seafood options for their sushi. Their sushi rice was cooked and seasoned perfectly as well. Because they have no frills and only do take-out orders, their prices are very affordable, $5.75-$7.00 per order which comes with about 8 pieces of sushi.  In addition to sushi, they offer a good selection of Japanese beverages and cute Japanese stationary. Service was casual and friendly. It&amp;#39;s a bit out of the way for me, but luckily they offer free delivery on orders over $25 (within a 10 mile radius).",6/1/2017,4

The rolls were pretty cheap, but I soon discovered that you get what you pay for...<br&gt;<br&gt;The meal itself was incredibly underwhelming. The salmon was unpleasantly chewy and largely tasteless. The spicy tuna roll was somehow both tasteless and also overly spicy. The spice didn&amp;#39;t have any flavor to it, it was just an unpleasant burning sensation. Also, the soy sauce packets were too small- the two packets weren&amp;#39;t enough to last the two rolls.<br&gt;<br&gt;If this is the best sushi in Burlington I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be eating sushi in Burlington again.",2/23/2019,2

We then shared 3 entrees: Lamb Shank Tagine, Chicken Tagine and Kefta Tagine with a side of Truffle Fries.

1024,THE DAILY PLANET ,"Center St, Bur","breakfast_brunch,cocktailbars,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,3.5 ,"I&amp;#39;ll start with the good stuff!<br&gt;Service was amazing. Everyone from hostess, to our waitress, to other waitresses we interacted with were so friendly and accommodating. I appreciated that the seating request I wrote in my reservation was acknowledged. <br&gt;The ambiance was so cozy and inviting. We loved the vibe, the lighting, the decor. <br&gt;The cocktails were super tasty and I felt like the drink prices were reasonable compared to other restaurants. <br&gt;There were a few standout dishes -- the falafel burger and the steak sandwich were both great. The fries were tasty and the greens were dressed perfectly. I also enjoyed the Vegan mint oreo cheesecake as a great end to the meal!<br&gt;<br&gt;The not-so-great:<br&gt;Mostly related to the kitchen and the value of the food. <br&gt;We both ordered burgers but quickly found out they were totally out of them. Our waitress was awesome to suggest alternatives, so we weren&amp;#39;t too bummed. <br&gt;Chicken drummies: This was the most disappointing dish. Mainly because the drumsticks were cold in the middle. The appeal was the guajillo raspberry glaze, but it tasted like a basic sweet/spicy teriyaki sauce. This was sadly nowhere near worth $19. It probably cost less than $2 to make.  <br&gt;Vegan nachos: I was excited to try these for the cashew cheese, but it was almost non-existent. I might have seen a few drips that was hardened on a couple chips, but it was mainly just tortilla chips with guac, beans and cilantro for $17. I asked for no jalapenos but they were on there anyway. It wasn&amp;#39;t a big deal because they were easy enough to eat around. These were also pretty cold. <br&gt;Also our appetizers came out just a few minutes before our main course, so we had sort of a backup of food that would have been great to have more spaced out.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I might go back for drinks and burgers but as a special occasion, multiple course dinner this missed the mark for us based on the total cost of the bill and quality of half of the dishes. Maybe the kitchen was having a really off night but I can&amp;#39;t say I highly recommend. It&amp;#39;s a solid 3.5 star restaurant.",4/3/2023,4

The food was interesting and delicious, service was unbeatable, and we thought we got great value for the money spent. <br&gt;<br&gt;My drink, a mocktail with tangerine juice and basil, was so inventive and tasty, and my salmon entree was fantastic. (I think the tabbouleh side would have been better warm or even room temp, but it was still very good as served.) Desserts were OUT of this WORLD -- we had the vegan mint chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate milk creme brulee, and I thought we would have to be rolled out of there in a food coma.<br&gt;<br&gt;The waitress truly went above and beyond, though, when my daughter (newly vegetarian) didn&amp;#39;t like her entree. We ordered a second entree for her, and the waitress comped it without so much as blinking an eye.

I have worked in restaurants since I was 10 years old and know how food should be prepared.

I come here so frequently I wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to look at the menu to order, but I do because the rotating seasonal options are always unreal.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you try nothing else, get the nachos. They are legitimately the best nachos ever. They recently switched back to the Nikki&amp;#39;s &amp;amp; Neil&amp;#39;s nachos (it was the Planet Nachos for a minute there). Nikki&amp;#39;s = vegan, Neil&amp;#39;s = meat. I highly recommend the Nikki&amp;#39;s nachos but if you&amp;#39;re not vegan, ask to swap the vegan cheese for the cheddar cheese...it&amp;#39;s definitely the cheese sauce that makes these nachos to die for.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for cocktails, you really can&amp;#39;t go wrong here, but I usually get the Drops of Jupiter and my boyfriend gravitates to the whiskey sour. We&amp;#39;ve both tried a handful of other cocktails on the menu and have never been disappointed, we just have found our favorites.<br&gt;<br&gt;I mentioned before, but have to quickly revisit the seasonal ops. Don&amp;#39;t miss these!! There are a few menu staples that are always there like the nachos, the Parmesan fries, save the planet burger, etc. But the menu rotates relatively frequently and I always love to try different small plates and sides. Last week I ordered the croquettes &amp;amp; the grilled red cabbage. Both were insanely good, especially the grilled red cabbage like seriously blew my mind I really was not expecting that level of flavor. <br&gt;<br&gt;Definitely will continue to come here on a regular basis.

I was hesitant at first because it&amp;#39;s listed as a seafood restaurant, but really they have a good balance of everything and seemed like it should have been just listed as American. My hubby and I ended up coming here twice because we enjoyed it so much the first time. The wait staff was great and very attentive (except for refilling water, you have to ask for that mostly but they were down to minimal staff because of the holidays). The space is dark and cozy and makes you want to take your time while you eat. They have beautiful large windows that you can see the NYE fireworks from when they shoot them off (unexpected bonus for us when we booked a reservation for our second meal on NYE). <br&gt;<br&gt;The drinks are great. The maple Manhattan is on point. Spirit-forward and not too sweet. The maple comes from the cherries that are soaked in it so it&amp;#39;s not overwhelming in the drink. I&amp;#39;m not a huge fan of maple but really enjoyed this drink. The pomegranate Paloma was also good but I recommend ordering something with bourbon to fit the mood of the restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;The food was so good. The reason we came here twice was actually because of the wedge salad! A salad of all things! It was the perfect combo of crisp, crunchy iceberg lettuce, amazing homemade ranch dressing, bacon bits, tomatoes, and avocado. What&amp;#39;s not to love? I highly recommend this dish and it was just as good the second night too so it wasn&amp;#39;t a fluke. The cauliflower soup was good but very rich. The lamb pasta was wonderful. The mushroom pasta was good but was nothing compared to the lamb one. I did not like the burrata, but that was just a personal preference. The flavors were good.

This had availability and decent reviews so I booked a table for 7:30 on a Saturday night. When we showed up, I was slightly concerned that this was a hotel restaurant and immediately lowered my expectations. However, I have to say, we had a pretty great experience!  We arrived almost 30 minutes early and were able to be seated right away. Our host, Richard, was such a lovely, charming man. Our server, Sarah, was also just delightful. The menu had a decent selection from burgers and salads to salmon and steak frites. Prices were on the high side but the food was quite good and all in all, we had a really great evening including some spectacular views of the sunset over the lake. We will be back!",9/12/2022,4

1069,BLEU NORTHEAST KITCHEN ,Cherry St,"breakfast_brunch,restaurants,sandwiches,seafoo",3,4.0 ,"This review is solely based on breakfast experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was okay. I think food itself is somewhere around 3-3.5 star (once again, breakfast only). <br&gt;However, the experience we had there ruined everything. <br&gt;<br&gt;TL;DR: If you or someone in your group has food allergies, save yourself from this place. <br&gt;<br&gt;As a guest of the hotel, I tried to have breakfast there with my family. It wasn&amp;#39;t packed at first but got busier. <br&gt;There was only one server, Daphine, and one very friendly host. I thought that the number of tables were a bit too many for one server to handle. However, it can never justify the server&amp;#39;s attitude nor rudeness. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waiting for her to come was okay and understandable. <br&gt;But when I mentioned food allergy (to specific nuts), she said that &amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t know it has nuts.&amp;#34;  I did not say nut allergies, I specifically mentioned two nuts, and told her that other nuts are okay and asked her if she could check what kind of nuts are in the granola. She grudgingly said she would do, then walk past us and yelled at someone at kitchen. Well, awkward, but I didn&amp;#39;t realized that that was a cue for us to leave. <br&gt;Later, she came back with our food, and told her that wheat bread or sourdough comes with the omelette, and she said again, &amp;#34;wheat bread has nuts and I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of nuts.&amp;#34; with rudeness. <br&gt;What she should have said, if she or the restaurant truly did not know what kind of nuts in that specific wheat bread, either they don&amp;#39;t know because the supplier did not provide the ingredients (highly doubtful) or she can&amp;#39;t figure it out because there is no one to ask at the moment. Rather than plainly rude, she could have tried to acknowledge the situation. <br&gt;By then, we were very uncomfortable and and had to leave without finishing our meal. <br&gt;<br&gt;Have you ever imagined that someone has a disability and he/she got denied (I don&amp;#39;t care, I don&amp;#39;t need to spare one more minutes to accommodate your disability) at a hotel restaurant? I have not. But I experienced it. My family member has food allergies and it is indeed a disability under ADA. It was a passive aggressive discrimination. <br&gt;<br&gt;She might be too busy to cover all the tables by herself, but that does not justify her attitude. <br&gt;<br&gt;We are staying 5 more days and will come back this fall, but we will never come back to here. Not worthy.",7/22/2021,1

1076,BLEU NORTHEAST KITCHEN ,Cherry St,"breakfast_brunch,restaurants,sandwiches,seafoo",3,4.0 ,"I called up for seats for first service thinking since it&amp;#39;s Super Bowl Weekend it might be &amp;#34;Fully Committed&amp;#34; to my delight the young lady who answered the phone could not have been nicer and gave us a table right away. I&amp;#39;ve heard about Bleu from a fellow chef and of their philosophy of attaining locally sourced produce. So I was excited to try them out and to try out their extensive fish options. <br&gt;Bleu is situated within the Hotel Vermont therefor the decor is a bit corporate but with that being said i was pleasantly surprised to see well placed noise reduction panels on the ceiling and noise reduction materials within the main room. High ceilings and large windows allow for a non cluttered space. We were immediately attended to by our server Ryan. He could not have been any more nicer, more professional, more knowledgeable of the menu and the wine list. We requested a coursed out meal which was not an issue and we were off to the races. <br&gt;Our first course was a dozen Washington based oysters which were fresh briny and perfectly shucked. We paired this with a  crisp, dry Le Berceau Brut from Limoux, France. The second course was the Burrata with roasted carrots, kale-pepita pesto, cranberry preserve on a toasted brioche. This was a flavorful dish with a lot going on. Maybe a bit too much. The burrata was creamy with crisp sides but the cranberry preserve was an odd pairing flavor profile with the roasted carrots and the pesto. Our third course was their signature Pan-Seared Scallops with roasted cauliflower, pomegranate molasses drizzle, and pistachios. This was indeed the star plate of the evening. Our scallops were expertly seared with a nice &amp;#34;chef touch&amp;#34; of cross hatching. The cauliflowers were not dried out with a nice crunch. The real surprise was the base of the dish. A puree of sunchokes. It was so creamy it was sublime. We almost ordered a second round!! <br&gt;Our fourth course was the Pan-Seared Jonah Crab Cake, with onion confit, pickled red onions, black garlic aioli. This was paired with a Steele Chardonnay from sonoma that was perfect. The crab cake was well constructed without too many fillers and seasoned correctly. The Black garlic aioli appeared to be an after thought on the plate presented as a lightly smeared streak. I would of liked a heavier application to accompany the crab cake. The two pearl onions were to have been confit,  but I think they missed the mark. Overall that dish was good but unfortunately did not reach the same level as our other courses. We finished our meal with a chocolate hazelnut cake with ganache and candied cocoa nibs, and whipped cream. The cake was moist and not too sweet, the whipped cream was a bit flat. Our waiter Ryan made this evening with his accommodations to our requests. Our overall experience was one of fulfillment, joy and satisfaction. I would recommend Bleu and will return again. <br&gt;Easy parking which is generously validated. Noise level moderate. Live music was a bonus. Although we did not sit at the bar after or before dinner, their bar menu looked worthy of a sit down.",2/2/2020,5

1078,BLEU NORTHEAST KITCHEN ,Cherry St,"breakfast_brunch,restaurants,sandwiches,seafoo",3,4.0 ,"Overall the food was a little better than average; however, the high prices, small portions of fish, and lack of finesse are why I am giving three stars. <br&gt;<br&gt;Was excited to try this restaurant with my family, the menu albeit pricey had delicious sounding options and the dining area had lovely aesthetic.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our drinks were good and the service was pleasant. My sister ordered the halibut which she raved about, and her boyfriend had the chicken roulade which he enjoyed as well. Unfortunately my mom and I were left rather disappointed. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the salmon (which was nearly $40 - quite steep for farm raised salmon). The salmon had nice flavor but it was overcooked slightly, the portion was skimpy (for roughly $40 that is unacceptable), and the risotto was bland as can be. My mother had  an appetizer salad and charcuterie board for her dinner, both of which she said were unsatisfying and not worthy of the high prices.",10/16/2019,3

The meat was sourced from high quality New England farms and the taste shines through. I had the NY strip and it was the best NY strip I&amp;#39;ve ever had. I ordered the steak medium rare and it was more of a medium but I was okay with that. My MIL ordered the chicken which was sourced from Misty Knoll&amp;#39;s farm. I am not a fan of chicken but Misty Knolls is a great chicken farm. 100% certified humane, high quality meat. Staff was knowledgeable and kind. Maple creme brûlée finished our dinner and it was quite large and very creamy. Maple was not screaming at you but rounded the custard flavor.

Next up, the Blue &amp;amp; Greens salad, how do you mess up blue cheese and bacon? They did. Greens were wilted like they sat under a heat lamp, bacon was underdone and blue cheese, well, extremely average. Pass! Next up, $38 halibut dish. The foul smell arrived before the dish, halibut so over cooked it was hard to cut, seriously. I think it was over cooked to cover the fact it should&amp;#39;ve been tossed.

We visited for their charcuterie workshop on a Sunday afternoon, and it was such a nice way to spend the afternoon. We got there early and were greeted by the most friendly workshop host/Dedalus employee, Brittany. They were still in the process of setting up the class, so we walked over to their little store/gift shop. I could&amp;#39;ve looked around in there for hours! They had so many unique and interesting things - panettone, gourmet chocolates, tin fish, meats, cheeses, gift boxes for the holidays, and much much more.<br&gt;<br&gt;The workshop we took was wonderful. It was lead by Brittany, their sommelier, and Dana, their cheese monger, and they taught us about different wine, cheese, and meat pairings to curate a holiday charcuterie board. The wines and cheeses they selected were divine and so delicious. I loved everything that they gave us, and they selected some pretty unique choices that I was worried I wouldn&amp;#39;t enjoy. Everything was wonderful, and they gave us a lot of information about everything we consumed.<br&gt;<br&gt;This store is such a lovely spot and I wish I had something similar near me! It&amp;#39;s cozy and classy, without being pretentious. Their sommelier knows so much about the wines they have and I never felt silly or stupid asking questions. She mentioned that she loves to ask customers about their preferences and budget and keeps a very open environment when people come in, and is able to select the best wines that suit them.

It is worth coming to for dinner, but even just for some snacks and wine it was lovely. The bottle list is full of gems, but they also have a substantial glass list.

The wonderful rustic edgy decor was the perfect foil for the display of unique wines and global provisions  such as I haven&amp;#39;t seen in Vermont or the USA. Variations of sardines , octopus and calamari to name a few. Then there was the selection of vinaigres and mustards and honeys ! All this before arriving at the cheese &amp;amp; charcuterie counters. The knowledgeable and pleasant staff willingly  engaged in conversation and suggestions, offering samples alongside. <br&gt;We were seated with a splendid view of the dining room, outdoor terrace and the seafood bar where later we would watch as they shucked our oysters . <br&gt;Jason Zuliani , owner of DEDALUS and our friend and fellow diner Chef Tom Bivins were old friends from NECI days. Jason graciously came over to greet us and before long we were engaged in a riveting wine conversation, to say he is a Wine Aficionado is no exaggeration. But the highlight of the evening was our mutual love of Jura Wines  which, as it happened,  he was drinking and now offered to share with me! Talk about Kismet - Jura wines are extremely difficult to find Stateside but at DEDALUS there is a small but exceptional selection. I&amp;#39;m completely speechless. We ordered a variety of dishes, each one exceptional with a very clean palette.: anchovies and capers with olive oil, The Market Board was over the top!, followed by a plate of salt bed oysters-delicate and oh so fresh. The fresh Scarpinocc pasta was sublime as was the tomato tartine . Dessert did not disappoint  - feeling emboldened I chose the basil ice cream with corn infused whipped cream while others chose the sourdough ice cream and the chocolate cake.

We had a reservation for our group and were excited to try the tapas style menu and wine. <br&gt;<br&gt;So why the 1 star review. <br&gt;<br&gt;It comes down to service. When we first sat down and were trying to figure out which bottles to order we asked to taste a few that were in the wine by the glass list to narrow our selection. The waitress was accommodating for the first 2 we tasted(ended up getting a bottle of one of them) but when we asked to taste a third she said &amp;#34;we are not in the business of giving free samples&amp;#34;.  We ended up ordering a bottle of the third wine we tasted but were upset by her treatment of us. We are not sure if it was the color of our skin or the waitress was just having a bad day. We proceeded to order many dishes and more wine. The cheese board was good but overpriced for what you got. Also the waitress did not explain what cheeses were where on the board so we had to ask another server for help. Overall the food was good but very small portions. and expensive for what you got. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were planning to address our displeasure with the service by giving her a 15% tip instead of our group&amp;#39;s standard of 20-25% and leave a review reflecting just the experience with the food and leave the service out of it. However when our bill came it had a 20% gratuity added automatically. We asked to speak to the manger and explained the situation. He at first was &amp;#34;shocked&amp;#34; but came back and said he could make any adjustments to the bill. We were asking to drop the tip to 15% which we felt was reasonable. There were no apologies for the behavior. It is clear that this restaurant group does not care about the customer experience which is such a large part of the dining experience.,9/18/2021,1

I asked for a glass of white in the style of the grape I&amp;#39;m used to drinking and was not thrilled with what the server suggested but it was nice with the oysters.

We sat at one end of a long table with others who were getting some sort of deluxe treatment from their server - I had to assume they were a friend or extended family - they got all kinds of tastings and special plates.

I also have come to expect that if I had a reservation, I&amp;#39;d have a table to myself. <br&gt;<br&gt;At the end of the meal, my husband got a big splinter from the table, and we were surprised there was no apology or offer of a dessert or coupon for the future. <br&gt;<br&gt;We enjoyed the food and wine and setting and will return.

But I think I might be spoiled by living in NYC and all of the delivery options we have here. I looked all over and almost every food shop I could find in Burlington was pickup only.

All the other pastries are also spectacular and the fried to order croquettes at the Stowe location are so yummmm! <br&gt;So why the loss in one star? Two reasons:<br&gt;They are heavily Kermit Lynch influenced for wine selection and it makes me a bit sad that they don&amp;#39;t carry smaller, more interesting labels<br&gt;The Stowe location really needs to up their Covid safety for food. They often leave pizzas, pastries, bread uncovered on the counter and I&amp;#39;ve seen customers cough on them, touch them with bare hands (not to buy but just touch), and stand over them breathing. This really makes me super nervous and I don&amp;#39;t understand why they leave food out in the open during these times.<br&gt;<br&gt;Other than that, Dedalus is one of the best things in town (both Stowe and Burlington)",2/20/2021,4

1160,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"*** New Year&amp;#39;s Eve 2021 Takeout Order ***<br&gt;This review is for takeout on 12/31/20.<br&gt;<br&gt;We placed an order to be delivered on New Year&amp;#39;s Eve at 7:00pm. After not being able to contact the restaurant due to their phone being busy for 20 minutes, I decided to drive there to see what was going on with my order. Upon arrival, I was told they were over an hour and a half behind schedule and if I wanted to cancel they understood. After some back-and-forth, they agreed to expedite my order since I was there and I finally walked out with my food at 8:35pm. <br&gt;<br&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing - the food was all amazing, if not excellent. The Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, Tom Kah, chive dumplings, and pot stickers with coconut curry sauce were all excellent. In fact, it&amp;#39;s the best Thai food I&amp;#39;ve had since leaving Pittsburgh (PA) and Durham/Chapel Hill (NC)... and I live in Boston currently. It wasn&amp;#39;t greasy, it was just the perfect level of spice, and the portion size was fantastic for the value. I&amp;#39;ve had mediocre Thai food before, and this was far and above that line - probably landing in the top 10 experiences I&amp;#39;ve had (and this was takeout, not even dine-in). However, the overall experience really left a bad taste in my mouth (and it had nothing to do with the food). <br&gt;<br&gt;In fairness to the restaurant and hostess who had to deal with me, the food was fantastic (once we got it) and she was very apologetic and polite throughout the process. I was given a glass of water to wait at the bar/pick-up area for the about 40 minutes I was there. We were comped an order of pot stickers and dumplings for the over an hour wait, which was greatly appreciated and had the delivery and other fees removed plus a discount for the inconvenience. <br&gt;<br&gt;It really is a shame I had such a bad experience with the takeout/pickup experience, as the food we ordered (and were comped) was fantastic. However, being that late with a known delay and no communication is unacceptable in the connected nature of the world that we live in. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would give this place another chance when we return to Burlington to see if this was a one-off issue with service and takeout. I hope to be able to adjust my rating the next time we are in town and they are not under such stress and duress during a holiday. I wanted to give a higher rating, but in the end given all the different outs that could have happened (and I&amp;#39;ve experienced) - it was just not in the cards. I will continue to dream of the food, and hope the next time around the delivery is a bit more crisp.",1/2/2021,2

1163,BANGKOK BISTRO IN THE ALLEY ,Mechanics Ln,"restaurants,tha",2,4.0 ,"Because they are family run, really accommodating, decorated nicely and chock full of creativity in an alley space, they are awesome!  The menu is fun and different, as most places where I have Thai food there is no such extensive drink menu, and the music is also boring.  It probably helps that one of the family members knows his music to be on the more modern, hipster side of livening things up with tunes.<br&gt;<br&gt;Anyhow, as for the seating, you can sit inside, somewhat inside in a covered patio like area or outside, in the alley.  The alley seating can be fun to see all the people walking around near the alley in the Church St area and/or just settling down into one of the nearby eateries, where there is live music on the weekends.  The decor is fun and fresh, modern and inviting.  I liked it a lot when walking in and appreciated it while dining.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu is not overwhelming, but it is fair.  It has classics like pad Thai and curry dishes, fried rice, pad kee mao, as well as specials that revolve around seafood and poultry.  They have an extensive appetizer selection, though, which I found impressive.  I enjoyed sampling the veg spring rolls and chive dumplings, though I was surprised they were deep fried wedges of what seem like a mix between the concept of dim sum turnip cake consistency and deep fried tofu in the triangular shape.  I would&amp;#39;ve liked some dipping sauce (peanut?) for the spring rolls, but that&amp;#39;s just because I like peanut dipping sauce.<br&gt;<br&gt;I like ordering many dishes rather than just one dish, so I opted for some salads, like the som tum and rocket + avocado.  The avocado was very generous, and I was very happy.  The papaya salad was fresh and not overwhelmingly spicy, but it definitely had a kick that made me unable to eat it inhalation style - slow consumption was best.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Then, of course, no good Thai food experience is complete without sticky rice-  I opted for mine in the sweet version with mango.  Wow, this was literally the largest portion of mango with sticky rice I&amp;#39;ve ever had at a restaurant, ever.  I feel like it was an entire large mango, which pretty much NEVER happens.  It was perfectly sweetened and ripened!  The sticky rice was also twice the serving of any place I&amp;#39;ve had sticky rice dessert!  So, it just made me happier (and fatter).<br&gt;<br&gt;They have a specials board, so just ask.  They&amp;#39;re very accommodating for dietary needs, as well, but just emphasize its importance.  They have homemade ice cream in the summer, at least, made of coconut and mango.  Yum!  The portions, again, wow - if you just had dinner, there&amp;#39;s low probability you could eat the whole dish and not feel extra bloated.<br&gt;<br&gt;If I feel like Thai in Burlington, I wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate to go back.",8/13/2019,4

Went in later and there was no hostess, waited in the doorway for 5+ minutes before anyone even looked our way. Waited half an hour to be seated which was understandable since it was a friday night. Ordered food and it was pretty good but not as great as I remembered. Certainly not close to the best Thai food I&amp;#39;ve had, but this is Vermont. The service was not good, our server never came back to check on us and it seemed like the whole staff was more interested in talking to each other at the bar than taking care of customers. There was a 4% service fee for using a card, wtf? On top of that, they do an automatic gratuity :/ I think it was 16 or 17%. The service was so bad I would never have left that much for a tip.

Loud music, but it gets you in the mood. Dark atmosphere with lights. Smaller place, cosy feel. <br&gt;Mao Ping Sushi, delicious meat, almost like teriyaki, on a bed of sushi rice. Great appetizer. <br&gt;Pad Thai very big portion. Exactly what I was expecting. <br&gt;Drunken Noodles were delicious. Not too spicy, pretty sweet actually. Perfect portion to fill you up.

Don&amp;#39;t allow so many customers to come in.  You can&amp;#39;t run a restaurant and expect your customers to wait for almost an hour for a simple dish.  The worst part?  They don&amp;#39;t even apologize for such poor service.

Partner and I really loved this restaurant the first few times we came, but have had horrible service and wait times the past two visits. A few weeks back we made a reservation and were seated right away, but our server walked away and didn&amp;#39;t come back for 20+ minutes. We weren&amp;#39;t able to order drinks, apps, or mains during that time and had to track down another server to get ahold of ours. Waited a very long time for food to come and were disappointed when the apps and mains finally arrived at the same time. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our most recent experience was worse. We arrived at 8:20 and didn&amp;#39;t receive our main dishes until roughly 10:00. We had to ask multiple times for our food, silverware, etc. and had four separate servers &amp;#34;attend&amp;#34; to our table throughout the night. While we waited, we saw several other parties who arrived after us receive their food and leave long before our meals came. My party let the waitstaff know how unhappy we were and they said they prioritize parties with reservation ahead of walk-ins. However, our last experience as guests who had a reservation does not back up that statement.<br&gt;Unfortunately we will not be returning because the food is just too expensive to justify the truly awful service. If you eat here, be prepared to wait at least an hour to get your food know that you&amp;#39;ll practically have to get out of your seat just to catch the attention of the wait staff.

Cooked correctly, to a perfect medium rare, which is at the limits to how much a steak should be cooked. Sides are often family style, order a couple things to share with everyone. The cocktail menu was good, and the maple Old Fashioned is one of the better of the genre I&amp;#39;ve had, of the various places that do that these days. The maple crème brûlée was arguably the biggest disappointment of an otherwise solid spread, with very little maple flavor coming through. Tasted mostly like a standard vanilla custard. Maple can be tricky to cook or bake with, but it seemed absent in this case. Oh, the bread and butter served to start was amazing though. <br&gt;<br&gt;The service was good. Burlington in this newly post pandemic area is still struggling to get staff, but the wait staff were courteous and prompt. Actually, I felt like our server was the perfect amount of interested. Not overdone, but attentive as needed.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ambiance is what I&amp;#39;d call &amp;#34;modern steakhouse&amp;#34;. Linen tablecloths, but not overdone red velour coverings like of yesteryear, where you&amp;#39;d expect to see business dealings.

We made a reservation in advance and were seated immediately, even after arriving a few minutes early. We got a table in a little nook where we were the only table which was nice and private. Initially, it took the server a little while to greet us.  <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered two sodas, an amaretto sour and a beer for drinks. Our water glasses were kept full throughout the meal. Calamari was amazing. A little differently prepared than I am used to but it was excellent. I would totally get it again. I also had a wedge salad which was good but they are never extraordinary, I just really like them. There was complimentary bread which was fresh, right out of the oven. The salted butter and the oil/vinegar mixture was good.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the 8 oz filet while the other three in my party got the prime rib which was on special. I ordered well done and I feel like it was cooked medium. My husband ordered medium and it appeared to be rare. Everyone still enjoyed their meals but it seemed that all of the steaks were a temperature or two off. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered a side of asaparagus and a side of brussel sprouts. I loveeee brussel sprouts and were looking forward to them. They were rather hard and didn&amp;#39;t seem cooked properly. Honestly, I debated sending then back but my husband kept munching on them stating they &amp;#34;weren&amp;#39;t the worst&amp;#34;. I just couldn&amp;#39;t eat them.<br&gt;<br&gt;As much as I wanted to order dessert, I was overly full and exhausted! If I were to go back I would overly specify the temperature I wanted my steak in hopes it would come out properly.",9/5/2020,3

1187,EB STRONG’S ,Church St,"newamerican,restaurants,stea",3,4.0 ,Delicious and top notch service. Been awhile since I had a good meal like that in Burlington. I didn&amp;#39;t find the bill overwhelming comparing to other steak houses. In fact the bill was just a little more than a chain Applebees or something at 20x the quality. Semi private parking lot with a back door leading right to the parking lot. Smart.,7/10/2022,5
1188,EB STRONG’S ,Church St,"newamerican,restaurants,stea",3,4.0 ,"We recently dined at EB Strong&amp;#39;s to celebrate a family event.  In summary, it was underwhelming.  First, let me say the service through the entire evening was spectacular.  The problem is simply that the food isn&amp;#39;t up to par for the prices being charged.  We started with an order of Crab Napoleon and Calamari.  The calamari dish was perfect in every way.  The Crab Napoleon was shockingly disappointing.  They advertise it as a dish of lump crab meat but that&amp;#39;s simply not the case - at best it was backfin or claw meat, and it was bland and flavorless.  We all ordered a combination of ribeyes, filets and bone-in filets.  The meat was well-prepared but the garlic mash potatoes were thin and lacking.  The truffle fries had been sitting awhile and were lukewarm when they arrived.  But the real shocker was the difference in price between an 8oz filet ($36) and the 12oz bone-in filet ($85) - essentially the 8oz filet with the bone left in.  Definately not in line price-wise and not worth the money.  The highlight of the meal was the Mud Pie - easily one of the best I&amp;#39;ve ever had.  But that&amp;#39;s the problem - you don&amp;#39;t go to a steak house for dessert. There are alot of reasonably priced, excellent dining options in Burlington - this isn&amp;#39;t one of them.",2/28/2022,2

1191,EB STRONG’S ,Church St,"newamerican,restaurants,stea",3,4.0 ,"Wonderful place, probably the best dinner we had during our stay in Burlington.  The server was pleasant and fun.  I did not find the prices that high - we spend almost as much the next night for far lesser quality food and experience.  We had a salad and a steak each, my wife added a lobster tail to her meal.  We both loved our meals, the lobster tail was a bit on the small side and probably not worth the extra cost.  But it was her birthday.",8/15/2021,5
1192,EB STRONG’S ,Church St,"newamerican,restaurants,stea",3,4.0 ,"What a HUGE disappointment! Overpriced, small poorly cooked portions and horribly cooked meat. What happened to this restaurant?! I&amp;#39;ve been here before and have had wonderful meals, this time I took my wife here as as she had just began eating beef, so what better place to take her for her first experience....right?<br&gt;<br&gt;EB WRONG! We ordered 2 of their 21 day aged bone-in in ribeyes And we&amp;#39;re very excited. What came out was flavorless and somehow burned on the outside, but properly cooked on the inside, the beautiful fat was not rendered at all but instead singed leaving a bitter spongy charcoal mass along the edges and not an ounce of seasoning! How is this possible? I know aged beef has amazing flavor but you still have to salt it! And at $60 a piece I expect near perfection!<br&gt;<br&gt;We asked for salt to attempt to salvage the meal And we&amp;#39;re then asked, by the owner, How the steaks were, we reluctantly said they were ok, but she could see the dislike In our faces and persisted asking, &amp;#34;really, how are they?&amp;#34; So we told her our issues...instead of being sympathetic she simply expressed that they are cooked over a 1500 degree fire and that was normal for their steaks. Maybe she is a new owner or not a steak eater? Maybe during the quarantine they forgot how to cook steaks? Maybe the dishwasher had to step in and cook that night? <br&gt;<br&gt;When the $200+ bill came we saw no attempt to redeem this bad meal, it was clear that both of us ate maybe 1/4 of the meat, the service was great so we left a nice tip and left with our steaks ONLY because we have chickens and didn&amp;#39;t want to waste food. <br&gt;<br&gt;After a cocktail and a latte I had an EB &amp;#34;STRONG&amp;#34; charcoal aftertaste in my mouth on the hour long ride back home. If you know and love Steak EB strongs will not be for you. Instead Save your money, go to Costco like I did the next day, get 3 prime Ribeyes for $60, Skip EB Strong and come to my house! I guarantee I cook a better steak than this so-called institution.",7/13/2020,1

1198,EB STRONG’S ,Church St,"newamerican,restaurants,stea",3,4.0 ,"This review sort of fluctuates between a 3.5 to a 4 for me and you&amp;#39;ll understand why. So after having a sightseeing day around Burlington and collecting goodies, we eventually ended up at the Church Street Marketplace around dinnertime. Unfortunately we had 20 minutes until the place officially opened so we wandered around the nearby shops until it was 5 pm. Needless to say, we were the first ones in there. It took a few minutes to get someone&amp;#39;s attention when we went inside but we just attributed it to the staff doing some last minute set-ups. It&amp;#39;s fine, no big deal at all. We were eventually seated by our waitress who was extremely courteous and polite. She obviously knew the menu well and I was impressed with her knowledge of the food and flavors. My uncle was set with the filet mignon with roasted garlic mashed potato, crispy onion, and demi glace and my aunt was planning to get the wagyu burger but decided to get the wahoo fish special with roasted vegetables. For me, I went with the braised beef short ribs with purple potato, potato mousseline, and crispy potato strips.  <br&gt;<br&gt;While waiting for our entrees, we also decided to get some appetizers: the seared ahi tuna and fried calamari. The seared ahi tuna had watermelon, sesame and soy mustard sauce. I&amp;#39;ve had my fair share of seared ahi tuna and found this one to be particularly delicious. I had my reservations about the watermelon with the sesame and soy mustard sauce but the flavors complemented each other very well. The slight sweetness of the watermelon and the umami from the sauce was wonderful with the seared ahi tuna, which was seared perfectly (some seared ahi tuna I&amp;#39;ve had in the past was seared far too long but these pieces were like 98% red still). The calamari was also unlike anything my family and I had ever had. It was surprisingly light and almost delicate. The roasted peppadew sauce that came with the calamari sauce was just okay to me but my aunt and uncle really enjoyed it. The bread and butter that came with the meal was spectacular to me. The bread was soft with a nice chew and it was accompanied with butter that could be salted with red Hawaiian sea salt or Hawaiian black lava sea salt. There was also the option of this light and fruity olive oil from the Saratoga Olive Oil Company with an aged balsamic vinegar.<br&gt;<br&gt;So why is this review not a glowing 5 stars? The wait for the food took a staggering long time... especially sine we were the only ones in the restaurant... We came in at about 5 pm and we didn&amp;#39;t get our main entrees until a little past 6 pm. I ended up having to rush out and put some change in the parking meter because we didn&amp;#39;t expect the wait to be so long. When our food finally did arrive, I was happy with my braised short ribs. They were tender and flavorful. Everything you would want with your braised short ribs. My aunt however... her wahoo was a bit on the overcooked side and she was disappointed. I had a bite of it and it was tough and on the dry side :( My uncle seemed to enjoy his filet mignon though. We were quite stuffed by the end of the meal and didn&amp;#39;t have any room for dessert. I didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to look at the dessert menu but past reviews indicate that they offer some impressive desserts. Maybe next time when I&amp;#39;m in town?<br&gt;<br&gt;TL;DR: All in all, it&amp;#39;s a very nice place in the Church Street Marketplace. The food I ordered was tasty and our server was very nice. Unfortunately, my aunt&amp;#39;s fish special was on the dry and overcooked side and there was quite the delay and a lot of waiting on our parts. If only service was a bit faster (or even someone coming by every now and then to give us food updates), I would give this place a solid 4 or higher.",11/6/2016,4

1201,EB STRONG’S ,Church St,"newamerican,restaurants,stea",3,4.0 ,"While in town for an anniversary celebration, we went here based on online reviews and a recommendation from our hotel.  Upon arrival for our reservation we were seated immediately and the staff was very friendly.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Once at the table our waitress came over quickly and was very friendly and helpful in recommendations.  She took our drink orders right away.  When she came back we indicated we were enjoying a nice dinner and wanted to order appetizers/salad before deciding on our entrees.  The waitress said ok, but the kitchen gets really busy as the restaurant fills up.  That was odd as I have never felt rushed like that at a restaurant.  So we ordered our salad and an appetizer.  We ordered the crab cakes and a wedge salad.  When our waitress brought the appetizer and salad she asked to take our order.  We indicated we were going to enjoy our appetizer then we would put in our order.  While the waitress was very friendly she said she needed to take our order as there is a 2 hour limit on a table due to additional reservations.  I was pretty taken aback by this as I&amp;#39;ve never had that said to me.  While I know the reality is that restaurants need to move tables, it&amp;#39;s something that shouldn&amp;#39;t be said to a customer.  I&amp;#39;m sure these words were something the management has their staff relay to customers, not just a waitress speaking on their own.  We did like the waitress a lot, but didnt like feeling rushed<br&gt;<br&gt;Food - my wife who loves crab cakes, was completely unimpressed by the crab cakes.  She said it felt like eating corn meal and didn&amp;#39;t feel there was much crab meat in them at all.  My salad was fresh and enjoyable.  <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered our entrees, I got a ribeye (no bone) and my wife got a surf and turf.  <br&gt;<br&gt;The food came quickly, both good and bad in our situation as we were trying to enjoy a nice anniversary dinner/night out together.  We both cut into our steaks and they were both cooked perfectly.  <br&gt;<br&gt;My ribeye was perfectly cooked but was very lacking in seasoning.  I got fingerling potatoes as a side and they were cooked properly but again lacked seasoning.  But the steak was an excellent cut and was not gristly and was properly marbled.  <br&gt;<br&gt;My wife&amp;#39;s mean her steak was cooked perfectly, a filet, but also lacked seasoning.  We both had to add salt to our steaks.  The lobster tail was good and cooked properly but was too heavily smothered in sauce and the whole plate was overly sauced.  The garlic mashed potatoes were good.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Would we go back?  Maybe, but we would definitely look for another steakhouse to try first before trying this one again.",10/29/2019,3

Seems to me like if I just cooked and chopped up a slew of rice and veggies and had some tasty fish at the ready, I could infact live on this cuisine all week long and be healthier by coincidence.

They&amp;#39;d offered a free coconut drink served in a coconut to the first 50 diners. I hadn&amp;#39;t seen that on the FB ad or we would&amp;#39;ve arrived at 11. I did see people with them at 3:30, so I guess they either sat around for a few hours or got super lucky they&amp;#39;d not run out yet when they came in.<br&gt;<br&gt;We got there about 3pm and the line was outside the door. Wait outside was only about 15 minutes. Took about an hour total to get our meals, but no complaints. Was to be expected. There were menus to look at in advance to figure out order in advance, plus an advertisement to download their rewards app to earn points towards future orders and $5 off first order. It also allowed you to add a credit card so you can pay easily each order (including adding a tip). You&amp;#39;ll soon be able to order in advance on it, but it&amp;#39;s not yet available. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the spicy ahi tuna burrito and the sweet ginger chicken burrito. <br&gt;When you get a tuna, you can ask for half tuna, half spicy salmon. That&amp;#39;s what we did. <br&gt;<br&gt;As we are ordering Chipotle/Cava Mezze/Core Eatery style (my three favorite chains), it&amp;#39;s exciting to see a ton of toppings to choose from.<br&gt;<br&gt;We therefore ordered as many of the toppings as you could without overstuffing them. I&amp;#39;d never had a sushi burrito before, but I&amp;#39;d heard of them. Think a thick, hand sized sushi roll that is only cut into half versus tiny rolls. In other words, niiiice. They have a neat way of making these pretty quickly. After the employee puts a layer of sushi rice on the nori, it goes through a machine that makes sure it&amp;#39;s really tamped down. From the looks on other people in line, everyone thought it looked cool. <br&gt;<br&gt;On the spicy salmon/tuna, we added sweet onions, cucumber, jalapeño, diced mango, ogo seaweed, shiso leaves, cilantro, green onion, pickled ginger, wasabi, sesame seeds, masago, Thai chili, toasted rice puffs. I got it with its suggested sauce, a sriracha aioli.<br&gt;<br&gt;The sweet ginger chicken we ordered with all of the above minus the Thai chili, masago, wasabi, rice puffs, ogo seaweed, getting garlic crisps instead.<br&gt;It came with a spicy ginger sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;The regular size was ample. I can&amp;#39;t imagine getting the larger one unless you&amp;#39;re splitting it. You could almost eat a regular over two meals.<br&gt;<br&gt;The verdict? The spicy ahi tuna and salmon combo was a fiery hit. Like, first time in a long time, I felt I could  breathe fire (in a good way). Loved it. It was bursting with flavors.<br&gt;<br&gt;The sweet ginger chicken was good, but I&amp;#39;m more of a sushi girl, so that wasn&amp;#39;t surprising. It was not spicy, in the event others would worry about that.<br&gt;<br&gt;With the BOGO, I hadn&amp;#39;t expected we the extra $5 would come off using the app and we hadn&amp;#39;t wanted it to, but it made for an extremely inexpensive meal for the value. I&amp;#39;ll have no problem paying $11.85 for full price in the future. <br&gt;<br&gt;The establishment itself is cozy with a decent amount of tables. They also offer miso soup and a dessert called Haupia, that is a coconut panna cotta with mango purée. I&amp;#39;m intrigued! <br&gt;<br&gt;Bonus is that all the fish is sustainable, the chicken is organic. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m stoked that this is on Church Street.

Yes, they are very friendly, but they seem like they are tired of what they do. There were a few times that they just scoop a tiny bit of ingredient into my bowl and I had to ask for more. As well some of the employees just kind of throw ingredients into my bowl without care. Or even worse like today that I asked for a large bowl, but got a regular instead and not sure why. There are a couple of people who work at this location do get everything right and I was very pleased by that. But there were many times that I just did not like the way they prepared my food.

They could have at least stirred it before pouring!<br&gt;<br&gt;Judging by the reactions of other diners I was correct not to order something pricier for lunch.",9/9/2022,4

The food was very yummy and filling. The lobster bisque was my choice, over the clam chowder. The lobster was great and the fries were made to perfection. Escargot with a glass of white wine was the perfect start to the meal. Thanks Tanner, for being a great server! Your recommendations didn&amp;#39;t disappoint. Looking forward to returning on my next trip. Enjoy!",11/19/2022,5
1270,SHANTY ON THE SHORE ,Battery St,"restaurants,seafoo",3,3.5 ,"Great views of Champlain and killer sunsets make this place worth it. Service was good, food and drinks were okay. We started with the mussels, about half of them were completely sealed, which required more work than we expected, using butter knives which at times resulted in flying mussels. Bloody Mary was not great, didn&amp;#39;t finish it. Salad with tuna was generous on the fish but the dressing was really syrupy and sweet. Would come back for views, apps and beer or wine.",7/31/2022,3
1271,SHANTY ON THE SHORE ,Battery St,"restaurants,seafoo",3,3.5 ,"The ambiance was pretty lively, and the server was very responsive. The bowl of chowder was incredibly delicious. The fried shrimp were off the chain, and the fried clams were fantabulous. The fried fish was fresh, but lacked flavor; perhaps using some seasoning salt prior to breading the fish would improve the taste. Aside from the bland fried fish, everything else was pretty good.",8/26/2022,4
1272,SHANTY ON THE SHORE ,Battery St,"restaurants,seafoo",3,3.5 ,"Whoa, what a letdown! We came here a year ago and had a great evening, amazing view, excellent service, and very good food. This year we had a very disappointing evening: amazing view, excellent service, and literally bad food.  <br&gt;You know what they say: never order the fish on a Monday night. Well, we tried it on a Sunday night and it was just bad. My wife&amp;#39;s fried seafood platter was almost okay, although I&amp;#39;ve had better at Red Lobster(!). But my broiled seafood platter was so completely tasteless that I joked to my wife, &amp;#34;Hey, I&amp;#39;ve got Covid, I can&amp;#39;t taste a thing.&amp;#34; She tried and the look on her face said it all...&amp;#34;What is this?&amp;#34;. The scallops were a pale white, not a hint of brown, and tasted like...nothing. No flavor. Not good, not bad, not spicy, not spoiled, just literally completely without flavor. How does that happen? Then the same with the haddock - a bleached white with not a hint of flavor, good or bad. Only the shrimp had a smidgen of flavor, and that was so bland as to not really count.<br&gt;Whatever they&amp;#39;re doing in that kitchen broiler on a Sunday night, cut it out! it&amp;#39;s just a terrible waste of food, and of my $32.<br&gt;So why 2 stars? The view, the service, and the drinks. Not enough to come back for though.",8/9/2022,2

The menu is what you&amp;#39;d expect from a touristy waterfront mega-restaurant, but the food and service were a step above what we normally expect from a place like this. <br&gt;Drinks at the bar were especially good and my wife had the best lemon drop she&amp;#39;s had on this whole trip. <br&gt;The large seafood platter was very good - nothing special but just what you want at a place like this. Being seated on the deck at the edge closest to the sunset certainly helped.<br&gt;If you just want to eat on the water and enjoy the sunset, this place is really very good for that.

We did sit by the window on the main floor which still gave us a great view. They also have an upstairs where the view is even better!<br&gt;For our lunch I started with a cup of their clam chowder which was fantastic. Hubs thought it was really good too and snuck in a couple of big bites. He had the shrimp cocktails which were huge. I stole a shrimp as well. Very fresh and plump and didn&amp;#39;t have a sea smell nor taste.  We decided to share the captain&amp;#39;s platter after seeing the server bring it out to the table next us.   Plenty of food to share. We actually still left a lot of food on the plate after stuffing ourselves. We would have taken it to go but we were still walking around and exploring.

1284,SHANTY ON THE SHORE ,Battery St,"restaurants,seafoo",3,3.5 ,"Super Stoked we found this gem in Burlington VT during our unexpected weekend getaway! After a long day of wanderlusting my Husband and I both had a hunkering for Seafood. After an extensive search on Yelp and Open Table we came across Shanty On The Shore. To our surprise there weren&amp;#39;t very many places offering lobster dinners locally so our choices were quite limited and while there had seemed to be mixed reviews for this place our gut feelings were telling us to go for it. We&amp;#39;re happy we did! <br&gt;<br&gt;Originally we had asked to be seated outside on the patio so we could enjoy the water views but the sun was just getting to the level in the sky where the umbrellas couldn&amp;#39;t block it out so it was pretty toasty sitting at the table. We kindly asked if we could be sat indoors instead and our waitress was happy to accommodate. Luckily there was a table available upstairs overlooking the front patio with an ocean view that went on for miles so we were pretty pleased about that. Sadly our original waitress couldn&amp;#39;t serve us so we felt bad about that and quickly apologized. They completely understood and made us feel better about the switch. Our new waitress was wicked sweet and friendly. She returned to our table often checking in to see if we needed anything. <br&gt;<br&gt;For apps we ordered the Clam Chowder, Oysters on a Half Shell, and the Jumbo Shrimp. Everything was fresh and tasty. They provided a heaping amount of cocktail sauce which we loved because it meant not having to flag our waitress down for more like we&amp;#39;ve had to do so many other times at other seafood restaurants. <br&gt;<br&gt;For entrees we both ordered 2 pound Steamed Lobsters with a side of fries. Both were very meaty and tasty! The melted butter was yummy too. <br&gt;<br&gt;From the location, the views, the accommodating staff, and the fresh delicious seafood...We couldn&amp;#39;t have been happier with our experience. While a tad pricey, it was worth it. We&amp;#39;d definitely come back again!",8/25/2020,5
1285,SHANTY ON THE SHORE ,Battery St,"restaurants,seafoo",3,3.5 ,"More shanty than shore. The deck overlooks a lovely parking lot. We ordered a bottle of wine and it took 15 minutes for us to learn they were out. It took another 10 minutes for three glasses of Prosecco to arrive instead. We had to ask for bread and then when the check came we learned we were charged for it. The salmon with maple ginger sauce might as well have been swimming in sugar water. Speaking of water - we were there for two hours and no one ever offered to refill our water glasses.  Clearly this restaurant specializes in fried stuff - if it&amp;#39;s not fried it&amp;#39;s not good. The service was S-L-O-O-O-O-W and it was a non-busy Monday night.

We ordered oysters and clam chowder and split the broiled seafood platter. The clam chowder was excellent! The other dishes just didn&amp;#39;t have much flavor, and the side options were very limited. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a fun, dog-friendly spot to hang on the deck with some drinks and snacks this is a great spot.

The service was amazing, my server was amazing and quick, and the food was also top notch. I got the clam chowder, oysters, and lobster roll, and all 3 were incredibly delicious.

They were serving large pieces of lobster tail and claws.<br&gt;I also loved the soup and I&amp;#39;m not usually the biggest fan of clam chowder. According to the menu, the soup is recommended by a food critic from The Boston Globe, who definitely got it right!

But we&amp;#39;re usually all business when I order.  I like the minimalist decor and high ceilings and abundant natural light.  <br&gt;<br&gt;It was great to see all the tables taken when I got there earlier in the week.  Seems like college students use Scout as an alternative study space when they want to get away from campus.  As long as they&amp;#39;re ordering stuff, that&amp;#39;s just fine.  Like I said, all the tables were taken, so I walked over to the nearly-empty counter, where there was one available outlet left.  Alas, it was that time of day when the sun was blazing full force right on the counter.  I plugged in my laptop and put on my sunglasses.  I was fork-tender and frustrated by inconsistent wifi in about 10 minutes.  So I closed up shop, got my drink put in a to-go cup, and headed out.  Bummer.  One of those shade blinds would make a world of difference.  There&amp;#39;s definitely room for a few more tables in there, but maybe it&amp;#39;s a fire code thing.  <br&gt;<br&gt;I like having Scout so close to home.  With a few tweaks to add comfort and convenience, it could be excellent.",11/23/2015,3

I was excited because it seemed like a great place for a cheap late night bite. That&amp;#39;s exactly what it is! They are open 20 hours a day and close at 3 am. There are no tables inside so you get your food to go. My favorite part about KKD is that they serve breakfast sandwiches the entire time they&amp;#39;re open, including something called a Shiner, which includes a golden hash brown, egg, American cheese, and other toppings on a toasted bulky roll. They also have grilled sandwiches, wraps and sandwiches, cold subs, melts, salads, vegetarian options, burgers, hot dogs, and fried food munchies! Some of the specialty burgers are not served after midnight and take a little more time to make.<br&gt;<br&gt;I got the basic shiner with bacon, and my boyfriend ordered the cheesesteak. It did take a little bit for us to get our food, but the people watching there late at night was pretty great (mostly a bunch of drunk college kids). The wait was worth it, though -- the Shiner is one of my favorite breakfast sandwiches. The hash brown was crispy, the bacon was salty, the egg was perfectly cooked, and the cheese was melted. The bun was really soft but definitely held up well. Ask for hot sauce and you&amp;#39;re good to go! The cheesesteak was also good with lots of veggies and tons of cheese, but I&amp;#39;m a big breakfast sandwich person. We found a bench nearby and chowed down on our midnight snack.

There were plenty of people set up all over the shop working on both occasions that we visited. The sad thing is that they did not have hot cider either time we went. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bathroom is by the imposing, industrial sized, wooden door but they do have one. While they do offer paper cups, the unspoken norm seems to be: bring your own. This may pertain more to VT as a whole and not just S&amp;amp;E. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our friends advised us that the shop is a good go-to but not their favorite coffee in town.

If I could rate just the coffee, it would be 5 stars.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been coming to this specific Speeder and Earl&amp;#39;s location for over 6 years now. My parents have been drinking Speeder&amp;#39;s since it first started and they passed their love of good coffee onto me. Speeder&amp;#39;s usually satisfies my craving for awesome coffee and I buy their beans by the pound as well.<br&gt;<br&gt;I hope that brief history serves to couch my review somewhat because, contrary to how it may seem, I do love Speeder and Earl&amp;#39;s. Unfortunately, I went into the Pine Street location to get some coffee beans and a cappuccino. While the cappuccino was pretty tasty, as always, the service and ambience were absolutely atrocious. It seems like whenever I go in there now there&amp;#39;s always a HUGE line of yuppies (I appear pretty yuppy sometimes too, no judgment) which sucks but I&amp;#39;ve come to expect it due to the annoyingly popular arts riot next door.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I really can&amp;#39;t overlook is the low-effort service I received while there. Both of the baristas had no clue what beans they had in stock and were unwilling to find out for me, update the list of beans by the pound available, or do anything else except tell me &amp;#34;Oh yeah, we&amp;#39;re frequently out of all kinds of stuff, it really depends on the grower&amp;#39;s season,&amp;#34; which is a completely garbage excuse in general, but especially for the kind of service I received. I know that they can run out of some varieties quickly due to demand but making me guess at a list of coffees until I hit one that&amp;#39;s in stock is completely unacceptable (not to mention it would take forever). I love Speeder&amp;#39;s but I honestly can&amp;#39;t keep buying product from a company where, on the rare occasion I go into the actual store/shop, they have hired useless employees that treat me like dirt.",12/6/2015,2

There&amp;#39;s not too many customers on a Wednesday afternoon either.<br&gt;<br&gt;I order a hot cocoa, and the cashier asks me what kind of milk I&amp;#39;d like. I choose skim milk. Then I choose a chocolate croissant, and then I&amp;#39;m informed that it ran out. And then I take a good look at the measly pastries I have left, nothing looks that appealing. I understand that no one really gets breakfast at 3pm but would it hurt to have stocked up on more pastries?<br&gt;<br&gt;I choose a cinnamon bun. The texture is flaky instead of doughy, so I already am annoyed by the amount of crumbs I got on my small plate. And it tastes like wood chips until I get into the middle of the bun, and then it&amp;#39;s like a diabetic punch in the mouth. It&amp;#39;s too sweet. I leave the bun unfinished, and that&amp;#39;s the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever put down a sweet of any kind. But I was seriously dreading the next bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;However, I have to give credit for their hot cocoa. The cream on top was lovely, I enjoyed the drink.",11/13/2013,2

In the vicinity of the shop today my partner was walking home from work and overhead the particular barista and several friends walking by saying, &amp;#34;Is that the girl who orders [insert drink off the menu here]!? Is that the girl!?&amp;#34; after which they all laughed at my partner.<br&gt;<br&gt;Grown people who seek out experiences to hurt other human beings are obviously snarky individuals, to say the least.

But additionally cruelly trying to embarrass patrons (when they think they aren&amp;#39;t listening) is troubling - again, regular paying patrons with regular orders and regular times who regularly help out paying their paycheck.<br&gt;<br&gt;We will no longer support this bad business or this snarky employee though we will miss the nice baristas who apparently don&amp;#39;t laugh at our orders.<br&gt;<br&gt;Furthermore, I work on Pine St - relatively close to Speeder &amp;amp; Earls - with a number of coworkers who often go to Speeder &amp;amp; Earls.

BUT the reason I&amp;#39;m not giving it 5 stars is solely based on the service. The bartender was super cold and aloof. Kind of a drag when you&amp;#39;re trying to have a fun night and feel welcomed in a new place.

The pizzas are always hot and fresh when they arrive and you will have a great time. <br&gt;<br&gt;My father visited us from overseas and he does enjoy his pizza. He did gasp at the price of pizza for all of us but I didn&amp;#39;t try and console him, I simply let the pizza do the talking. It&amp;#39;s safe to say we ordered Leonardo&amp;#39;s three more times during his trip, it was also his send off dinner which means he loves it. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, my wife and I have never had a bad experience with this Leonardo&amp;#39;s and the pizza is always consistent. They give you paper dishes, cups and plastic cutlery. They give you way too many but it saves you having to buy your own!! <br&gt;<br&gt;10/10 great pizza. Much sad will miss. Please open a store in Cambridge MA, or begin delivering here!!!",6/3/2017,5

He let my daughter watch him prep the dough for future orders and we watched as he worked his magic. He even explained the reason why King Arthur Flour was different from most others. Great customer service when he immediately recognized that my daughter was tired and hungry.<br&gt;<br&gt;Onto the food... We ordered a medium pizza, half cheese, half pepperoni &amp;amp; mushroom.

Then for our main menu, we ordered two pizzas, the first pizza had half Brussel Sprouts with Truffle Oil (added bacon) and the other half Chipotle &amp;amp; Honey (added chicken) per the owner&amp;#39;s suggestion. The second pizza had Loaded Potato and Ham &amp;amp; Artichoke.  All of it was delicious. And lastly we had the smores pizza for dessert...<br&gt;<br&gt;GO GET THE SMORES PIZZA NOW. You will not regret it. Same dough as the pizza but left a little bit undercooked, drizzled with chocolate and mini marshmallows with graham crackers sprinkled over the top. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall great experience, great people, will definitely be back.",5/19/2015,5
1531,LA BOCA WOOD FIRED PIZZA ,North Ave,"italian,newamerican,pizza,restaurant",2,4.0 ,"We were in Burlington and decided to get away from the downtown area and were also in the mood for Italian. So we checked out La Boca on Yelp and it had a decent rating. I called for a reservation and was told they couldn&amp;#39;t accommodate us until 8 pm. No problem, but when we got there the place was deserted. I can&amp;#39;t imagine that all of their diners magically disappeared at 8 pm. <br&gt;<br&gt;We were seated and ordered a starter of dough and sauce. It started out promising, but our meal went downhill from there, because while the wood fired strips of dough were tender and tasty, our entrees were just mediocre. <br&gt;<br&gt;My companion ordered the chicken pesto pizza. The tomatoes were terrible and out of season, of course. Our waitress said the kitchen makes fire roasted Roma tomatoes every day. A good chef should&amp;#39;ve known that fire roasted or even sun dried tomatoes would be a vast improvement over out of season tomatoes. Their pizza has a terrific crust, but it was marred by below average toppings. <br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the chicken piccata. Again, it was just average. The chicken was overcooked and tough. A good piccata has thin pounded chicken breasts that cook up nice and tender. The chicken in the dish could&amp;#39;ve been saved by the wine and caper sauce, but there just wasn&amp;#39;t enough of it. The pasta was cooked al dente, but it was very dry. The dish needed twice the amount of sauce. The dish was just blah without it. I also had to ask for Parmesan cheese so I could get some added flavor. I don&amp;#39;t think you should have to ask for cheese at an Italian restaurant. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our bill came to $60 with a tip and included one glass of wine. <br&gt;<br&gt;We could tell they were trying. The service was okay and the entire first page of their menu tells their story and is all about using reclaimed materials and attempting to use locally sourced ingredients. I do hope they can survive. It&amp;#39;s a neighborhood kind of place. Unfortunately, there is nothing special about the food.",4/1/2017,3
1532,LA BOCA WOOD FIRED PIZZA ,North Ave,"italian,newamerican,pizza,restaurant",2,4.0 ,This is probably the worst experience I have ever had. First the food took 1 hour to come out.

It took 1.5 hours to get our food for our party of 3. We asked for bread to hold us over while waiting and it came after our dinner!!  Really?  The waitress avoided us knowing it was taking too long. We thought maybe it was just a bad night for staff and tried last night. At 7:30 pm on Memorial Day weekend when the city is jammed we were greeted by the host saying they could seat our party of 8 but they just let a server go and wouldn&amp;#39;t serve us well.

However, things have changed and we no longer feel like we can get a good meal at La Boca. Last night everything we ordered lacked flavor, the ingredients of our favorite antipasto salad had been changed (delicious smoked gouda was replaced by something with far less flavor, the salami was much lower quality, the dressing lacked the familiar tang and the tomatoes were nearly inedible) and there was an olive pit on my pizza (which I didn&amp;#39;t discover until I brought it for lunch today).

Unfortunately, the service and food quality have declined since the restaurant changed ownership a couple months ago. Within the last month, we gave the new owners 3 tries and every time the food was so bad (and wait time) that we got all our entrees comp&amp;#39;d. That is not all, the servers and cooks we got to know over the years are gone. Everyone is inexperienced and the owners are never there. No management!?!? Part of the charm of the old Boca was the owners. They treated everyone as part of their family. It no longer feels that way. I suspect a lot of this is has to do with their attitude toward their staffs and customers. <br&gt;It is sad since it used to be such a great place. We miss the former owners.

I got a medium one that stretched into two meals, for a very low, price of 5.99! My S.O. got a large and wasn&amp;#39;t even able to finish it. This is a great testament to the size of these sandwiches!<br&gt;<br&gt;We did have a few problems with the place, though: The service was not pleasant. The music they played was tolerable, until they turned it up so loud that It was hard to even hear my S.O. speak. Beyond that, it wasn&amp;#39;t even music that would have been acceptable in a professional setting.<br&gt;<br&gt;The store was also filthy. There were cigarettes on the floor, and piles of cardboard that had flies crawling all over them. If they cant handle simple things like sweeping, and taking out the trash - how do they handle their food prep area?<br&gt;<br&gt;For what it&amp;#39;s worth I&amp;#39;d come here again in the future despite the negatives. The food really was good, and the prices were great. Maybe next time it will be a bit clear, and a bit more professional, and I can give a better review!",8/28/2013,3

Muzo&amp;#39;s is a lovely little food cart on Church Street, across from Starbucks and the mall, so around the intersection of Bank Street, I guess. The man running the cart was very friendly, and watching him make my food was fun for me. The kebabs he serves aren&amp;#39;t shish kebabs, so the meat&amp;#39;s not on skewers, but served as smaller pieces wrapped in Turkish pita bread, which is so much tastier than your average pita bread. I had a chicken kebab (which had a fancier name that I currently can&amp;#39;t remember), and I&amp;#39;m salivating just thinking about it. The chicken is seasoned and served in its own delicious juices, wrapped in the pita with diced fresh tomato and parsley, I think? If parsley&amp;#39;s really not your thing, avoid this dish because there&amp;#39;s quite a bit of it. But I will the usual parsley-ness (that weird, bitter-ish overtone) was unnoticeable, and combined with the tomato it was just the right amount to cut the greasy heaven of the chicken juices. It was actually very refreshing, and a perfect complement to the chicken&amp;#39;s heavy flavor.<br&gt;<br&gt;The portion made for a hefty, filling lunch.

1678,THE CAFE HOT. ,Main St,"breakfast_brunch,restaurant",ul,4.5 ,"As somebody that enjoys gourmet breakfast sandwiches, and has eaten an absurd amount of them in his lifetime, i can safely say that the egg sandwich from cafe hot is the best i have ever had. The eggs are cooked perfectly, the cheese is griddled to produce a crispy skirt, the milk buns are house made and amazing, and their two sauces tie everything together. Avo isnt needed, but its a great addition. I cant recommend this place enough. The bonuts (biscuit donuts) are their other claim to fame. They are unique, beautifully layered and crisp. So delicious!   Additionally, despite being very busy The staff are all extremely friendly and fun to chat with at the window.

1681,THE CAFE HOT. ,Main St,"breakfast_brunch,restaurant",ul,4.5 ,"I had read about the arrival of this restaurant downtown. Today I finally had an opportunity to go. I scanned the door for a sign regarding their mask policy, and there was no sign. At all. Other than a sign about needing a vaccine card to sit. I have such a thing so I walked in sans mask. <br&gt;<br&gt;My partner and I found the menu terribly confusing and the items on it not particularly appealing. As I was standing there in line, I decided despite being baffled and not enticed by the menu that I would stay and try the least tortured item in the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;At that point, one of the owners started shouting at the room in general a long soliloquy about going to the website and reading the menu before getting to the register to order. Apparently, people who are confused by the menu&amp;#39;s presentation in person need to do their homework in line before arriving at the register. I was trying to block out his incredibly loud and annoying interruption to everyone&amp;#39;s morning groove, when he spotted me without a mask. <br&gt;<br&gt;He pointed at me and then disappeared. He came back with a mask (from god knows where) and handed it to me. I do not put on strange masks handled by other people. I  am perfectly happy to comply with requests to put on my own mask. I have no problem scanning a door for a mask request. There was none. <br&gt;<br&gt;Needless to say, I did not stay. I did not order one of their concoctions of tortured food, I did not check the website to make sure I understood prior to ordering, and I did go to a kind, quiet, yummy alternative (where I happily complied with their masking sign).",4/9/2022,1

Both slices were big and tasty! The crust on the pizza was crisp on the bottom, and the whole slice was covered in pepperoni. I tried a sour beer that was really delicious and we also got one from Hill Farmstead which was amazing! <br&gt;<br&gt;I love that they have gummy candy on their menu - listed as &amp;#34;free range, boneless&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sustainably harvested&amp;#34;!

It gets super crowded, is dog friendly (inside and out!) and is usually a good time. They also serve some of their regular menu offerings from a food truck out back. I am OBSESSED with their pork belly gyro. Perfectly sweet pork belly, crunchy kimchi, and some kind of magic sauce. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ethiopian night - seems to happen once a month or so and a local woman takes over the kitchen. There are no Ethiopian restaurants anywhere nearby so I am super grateful for the option. You have to make reservations beforehand and it does get crowded. Food is pretty good - an odd group of roasted veggies accompanied our meal. Traditional sour injera and the vegetarian platter had the typical lentil curries and greens. Small thing missing is the small salad that typically comes on an Ethiopian platter (and their limited menu didn&amp;#39;t have an option).",1/28/2019,4

I was only here for one night and used Yelp to find this place.  I wanted a place at the bar to eat dinner, but all spots were taken. Luckily one opened up after 10 minutes.  Pretty busy for a Wednesday night. <br&gt;<br&gt;A pretty interesting concept melding art, food, drink, and art. I didn&amp;#39;t have much time, so my review covers food and drink only. Had a Gin N Juice cocktail - tasked good, a bit too sweet for my liking. To start I had the Pork Belly Bao with cucumber - excellent dish. The fresh cucumber and cilantro meshed perfectly with the Pork Belly.  For the main course, I had the Gnocchi - this dish was good, not great. To be honest, there were so many other things that looked interesting on the menu, that I will have to make a second visit. <br&gt;<br&gt;Great, prompt service at the bar.

1740,ARTSRIOT ,"Pine St, Bur","bars,eventservices,newamerican,nightlife,restaurants,venue",2,4.5 ,"I&amp;#39;m always a fan of this place. I love the atmosphere and the food. My friends and I also really love the trivia nights. But I&amp;#39;ve had a few issues with making reservations. Number 1, about 90% of the time when I call there, I end up having to leave a message. Number 2, after leaving said message, I get no response at all. Number 3, because of this, I have to perpetually call and call and call until I get someone on the actual phone/leave multiple messages.<br&gt;<br&gt;Well this time, I went with a group of 6, and we really wanted to do trivia. I had done the aforementioned steps above and got no answer on whether or not we had actual reservations. I figured I&amp;#39;d get there early to try and see if we could snag either an extra table or at least something close by. I was fine with whatever. When I got there, they said they were full. I explained that I did try and call last week, but to no avail. I understand now (after going through this process) that we need a call back/confirmation from a host that we actually have seating. <br&gt;<br&gt;The host then said, &amp;#34;Let&amp;#39;s see what we can do.&amp;#34; While they were trying to accommodate the six of us, I did tell them about how I did definitely leave a message, and that the last time I tried to set up a reservation, no one answered the phone and I had to call multiple times, and finally got so frustrated I ended up posting on the facebook event wall asking about making reservations. Just simply trying to make some sort of conversation happen instead of awkwardly standing in front of the host table.<br&gt;<br&gt;Host: Well you just saw, we answer the phone. If you don&amp;#39;t get a call back from us, you don&amp;#39;t have a reservation.<br&gt;Me: I understand that, I&amp;#39;m just telling you what happened so maybe it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again.<br&gt;Host: If you&amp;#39;re that upset, you don&amp;#39;t have to eat here.<br&gt;<br&gt;Meanwhile, I&amp;#39;m really not as upset as they appear to make it, but I&amp;#39;m just simply waiting and I have resting bitch face I guess. But he keeps on and on about how &amp;#34;If i&amp;#39;m that upset, I don&amp;#39;t have to eat here.&amp;#34;<br&gt;To which finally I reply &amp;#34;The more you keep talking about it, the more upset I will become. I just want to wait for my group.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;The Host walked away after that. I could see he was trying to avoid me. My group got there, we sat down, we had a really good time. Apparently a group had cancelled and we were able to get a seat actually inside the events area. The other host was really nice about it, and I had felt bad for being slightly snippy before, so I tried to be grateful and forget about the debacle that got us into the place. I was really appreciative that they did try to find us seating, instead of saying &amp;#34;Hey we&amp;#39;re full I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;#34; but I don&amp;#39;t think the added badgering really helped. It felt almost like the first host really didn&amp;#39;t want us to be there. <br&gt;<br&gt;Still love the food! And the trivia is great when it comes down to it. But sometimes these impressions do last. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll just avoid that host, but there needs to be a better system for making reservations during events like this.",9/21/2016,4

She let us have time to talk and go over the menu.<br&gt;<br&gt;The menu has great options too. It&amp;#39;s organized by small, medium, and large entree sizes, with reasonable prices to match each portion size. I ordered the Cucumber Salad and the Popcorn Chicken, both from the medium portions part of the menu. Both surprisingly spicy!! In a good way. The pickled shrimp and radish in the Cucumber Salad helped a lot, and the spices in the Popcorn Chicken were crispy and blended. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been here for the food truck stops during the summer, and they&amp;#39;re fantastic.

The food was interesting and well executed, and it was served in a casual laid back setting that was utterly lacking in pretension. The food was fun as was the entire experience. <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu, stamped with the current date, obviously changes somewhat frequently. It differed from the one online, but that worked out well for us, as it featured a couple of things we&amp;#39;d seen elsewhere but that weren&amp;#39;t currently listed on the website. (Yum spicy chicken sandwich!)<br&gt;<br&gt;The brocolini dish, with carrots and farro was straight up incredible. It ranks as one of the best vegetable dishes I&amp;#39;ve had anywhere. The flavors played off of each other perfectly. I know I&amp;#39;ve already used the term once, but the dish just had a playful sense of fun to it. It was brightly colored and looked as good as it tasted. <br&gt;<br&gt;The kimchi pork cheek was also excellent. The meat was tender and delicious. The sauce spicy and full of flavor. Each bite was really a joy to eat. We were torn between several dishes, and while I&amp;#39;m sure that we couldn&amp;#39;t have gone wrong, we were thrilled with our choice. <br&gt;<br&gt;Finally, we liked our server. He was laid-back and willing to answer the many questions we had about the menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;Oh, and one last thing. The price was right. It proves that an excellent and innovative meal does need to be out of reach. This is a place that I&amp;#39;d easily feel like I could afford to visit frequently.

We ordered a little burger, a side of fries and the triple hunan bowl, without pork. We were warned that the burger was very little indeed, and went for it. It was tiny. It was basically a slider, but we were warned. It was really delicious, though, and had us thinking we should have both gotten full-size burgers. <br&gt;<br&gt;The fries were utterly negligible. They&amp;#39;d have not been out of place in a diner, aside from the $6 price. Those were not $6 fries, they were $1.50 fries at best. Overly crispy and bland. <br&gt;<br&gt;My food, the triple hunan bowl (without pork) definitely had pork in it.  Like the guy made it, remembered to leave the pork out and fished it out, but missed some pieces. Pretty disappointing when I bit into those bits of oddly-colored &amp;#34;chicken.&amp;#34; The dish itself wasn&amp;#39;t bad, but was very dry and not all that flavorful. It cost $17. I would rate it an $8 bowl at best. <br&gt;<br&gt;My friend got a drink. It cost $13, which I think is ridiculous, but it was strong and she really liked it, so... that&amp;#39;s perfectly fair.<br&gt;<br&gt;After dinner we tried a dessert and got the peach... uhh... I forget the name. it was a peach cobbler sticky bun thing with ice cream. It was pretty alright, no real complaints there. I wouldn&amp;#39;t get it again, but it was okay.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our waitress (Zoe) was very nice and capable.<br&gt;<br&gt;In the end I thought the food, minus the burger, was just okay. The prices, though, were taking things too far. $17 for a bland and dry bowl of chinese food and $6 for really awful fries is pretty unforgivable, even for fare in a modern and pleasant hipster setting.<br&gt;<br&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind coming back and trying one of those burgers.

I also got a recommendation from the bartender to try the Peach emoji - I was worried it would be too sweet or too peachy, and it was neither. Instead, it was fruity without being cloying, and sophisticated. Watching the bartenders was so much fun - you can really tell they care about the craft of cocktails and put a lot of heart into making them.<br&gt;<br&gt;Note that the machines all take tokens so you&amp;#39;ll need cash to exchange for tokens.

We chatted with the bartender (can&amp;#39;t recall his name, sadly) and he prepared us a ton of great drinks from their menu and a couple off menu items as well. I&amp;#39;d heard great things about swapping in Bar Hill Barrel Aged Gin for bourbon (not a bourbon fan. I know, I know.) and I was not disappointed. Overall great place to stop in. The atmosphere is laid back and the bartenders are extremely knowledgeable.",2/18/2020,5
1773,THE ARCHIVES ,College St,"arcades,arts,beerbar,cocktailbars,nightlif",2,4.5 ,"A pretty awesome Barcade that&amp;#39;s along Church Street. The Archives is a good mix between cheap, retro arcade games and craft cocktails, beers and food. The games a relatively cheap, which makes sense since they&amp;#39;re pretty dated (although that&amp;#39;s part of the fun), running about 25-50¢ per credit. Think of games like Pac-Man, The Simpsons or X-Men arcade.<br&gt;<br&gt;The beer list there was pretty extensive and included lots of local craft beers. I didn&amp;#39;t order a cocktail or anything off of their unique drink menu, but some of my friends did and they were pretty happy. The selection of liquors behind the bar is pretty extensive so I bet that have whatever you&amp;#39;re looking for.<br&gt;<br&gt;Would love to come back in the future to get some food along with my games. Definitely recommend anyone in town checking out, it&amp;#39;s a great balance between trendy craft drinks and old school games.",12/30/2018,5

They do have Street Fighter, so right off the bat, that puts it ahead of the game for me. (pun intended)<br&gt;<br&gt;My gals and I heard they do really amazing cocktails. I didn&amp;#39;t try one because I had been drinking beer all day, and I&amp;#39;m way past old enough to know you don&amp;#39;t mix liquor and beer unless you want to be sick all night. However, I did see the bartender making one of these cocktails with two shakers and about a ten minute long dance and mixing process. So I&amp;#39;m hoping, after all that, it was one darn fine cocktail.<br&gt;<br&gt;The bar is divided into two areas and both walls are lined with vintage arcade games with pinball in the back. You have to trade your dollars in for tokens, but you get four for a dollar, and all the games we played were only a quarter a piece. <br&gt;<br&gt;I mean, if you want to go grab a beer and play some Pac-man, this is the place. But other than the games, this is just your standard pub.",3/28/2018,4
1777,THE ARCHIVES ,College St,"arcades,arts,beerbar,cocktailbars,nightlif",2,4.5 ,"The Archives is basically like Barcade in NYC, but it&amp;#39;s a bit more manageable when it comes to spacing and layout, as well as having an arguably better selection of beer (the sticker on the door stating that it&amp;#39;s an authorized reseller of Heady Topper is a good start). The outside is quite innocuous, but once inside, you can mix your passion for good beer and cocktails with the games that you (and possibly your parents, for some of them) grew up with. The folks at the bar are very easygoing and get you a drink quickly, and even on a Friday night (albeit, we were there on the later end), it didn&amp;#39;t take much time at all. There&amp;#39;s a phenomenal selection of beer both on tap and in cans (the Alchemist beers, unsurprisingly, are served in the can), but I was told that folks also enjoyed the cocktails that were on hand as well. Don&amp;#39;t aim to come here looking for food, though - you literally have one choice - the cheese board - although it is quite good, with the cheeses the night we were there all from Jasper Hills. There&amp;#39;s a decent amount of seating as well, whether it be at the bar, at the counter lining the window, or with a handful of longer tables on the far side of the space away from the entrance.<br&gt;<br&gt;As for what else you can do? It&amp;#39;s classics going at least 20 years back - old Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat machines, NFL Blitz, and ones going back as far as Galaga, Pac-Man and Centipede. Despite the age of the machines, only a couple were out of order at most. Even though you do still have to get tokens to play, the machine is (very wisely) updated to accept credit card as a payment option. It&amp;#39;ll be easy enough for you to acquire the tokens you need and play the game of your choice to your heart&amp;#39;s content - all while sipping on fantastic beverages. Given the lack of food, you probably shouldn&amp;#39;t park yourself here all night, but given its proximity in central Burlington, everyone should show up and take a visit down nostalgia lane to play the video games of the past while sipping on the (much better) beer of the present/future.",11/12/2018,5

You couldn&amp;#39;t really distinguish the different elements in the maki. <br&gt;<br&gt;Unagi Avocado Maki - difficult to taste the unagi / eel or see it. Very heavy on the rice (which was fresh though). <br&gt;<br&gt;Albacore Maki - simple, basic and fresh. <br&gt;<br&gt;Spicy Tuna Maki and Spicy Salmon Maki - nothing stood out. Flavors were muted.

Asked her how big it was, she said &amp;#34;very small&amp;#34; and made a ring visual with her pointer and thumb on both hands to confirm how small it was.  When it came.. it was a gigantic entree sized bowl. Told her it was too big (mind you I  ordered spring rolls and 3 maki rolls) and she rolled her eyes. I&amp;#39;m sorry - it&amp;#39;s NOT what i ordered. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ordered two spice tuna rolls and one spicy salmon.. instead she brought three spicy tuna rolls. Asked for extra sauce ON the rolls.. she brought TWO LARGE sides of Spicy mayo- and then charged us three dollars for it! <br&gt;<br&gt;Shrimp pad tai came with shrimp IN THE SHELL. We told her.. and she told us we can take the shell off. We sent it back. <br&gt;<br&gt;Asked for the bill- they charged us for the large udon entree, two sides of mayo and the shrimp pad Tai- all of which we didn&amp;#39;t eat. When we told her there was a mistake and they needed to be removed from the bill- she got upset! <br&gt;<br&gt;And the WORST part about all of this- is I breast feed and I asked if Tai tea had black tea (caffeine). She said no! Just orange blossom. Great! I ordered it. Guess who&amp;#39;s wide awake with a screaming six month old at 12 am!? I haven&amp;#39;t had caffeine in 15+ months.

1822,ASIANA NOODLE SHOP ,"Church St, Bur","korean,noodles,restaurants,sush",2,3.5 ,"My fiance and I were shopping around the Church St. marketplace while on a weekend trip to Vermont, and while there are lots of restaurants in this area, many of them are Italian, Pizza, or simply just heavier, fried foods etc. We were happy to stumble upon the Asiana Noodle Shop to get some lighter fare! They have a very small area for outdoor seating and we were lucky enough to grab the last table. Our waitress brought out waters and asked if we were ready to order relatively quickly- we asked for another minute and she was gone for quite a while. Having said that, it seemed like this poor girl was one of the only people waiting on tables outside and had to keep running in and out to get things for people. <br&gt;<br&gt;Anyway, they have a great selection of different Asian dishes, but since my fiance is Korean we immediately gravitate toward anything Kimchi-related. We both ordered the cargo noodles: Udon, Beef and the Kimchi broth, which had tofu, a variety of mushrooms, bok choy and scalllions as well as large pieces of Kimchi. <br&gt;<br&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t wait a super long time for the food to come, however they only brought my fiances bowl out and said mine would be out momentarily. 10 minutes went by and my soup had still not arrived. We were confused by this since we ordered the exact same soup. It was kind of awkward sitting there waiting for my soup as my fiance was hungry but did not want to eat without me. Finally, close to 15 minutes passed and we waved down a waitress to ask her where my soup was. A few minutes later, she emerged with my soup. It was truly delicious. We both enjoyed it. HUGE bowls of broth filled generously with udon noodles and veggies. I would have liekd to see more tofu (I only had two small pieces in there) but overall we were both very happy with the meal. The prices were also reasonable. <br&gt;<br&gt;We&amp;#39;d definitely come back here the next time we&amp;#39;re in the area, although we might just order one soup to split- they are really big servings!",9/24/2017,4

This high rating is due mainly to the atmosphere, service, and quality of items being served. <br&gt;The location is right at North Beach on Lake Champlain near the North Beach Campground, has about 8 tables and a small tiki bar.  It is located right beside the beach&amp;#39;s snack bar, but has a very different vibe than a typical snack bar atmosphere. The BH gets busy during the weekends, but at no point are you felt rushed while hanging out. This was amazing, being able to sit back, enjoy the lake view with a beverage, and have not a care in the world. The servers are great and work hard, especially when someone calls off at the last minute. Personable and friendly every single time we visit. <br&gt;<br&gt;Now to the food and drink. They have a nice mixed drink selection along with a well-stocked top shelf bar. The beer menu goes well beyond the mass-produced national brands. A good variety of quality VT craft brews and ciders make up the most of the list (Citizen Cider-the best &amp;amp; 14th Star Tribute-amazing and veteran owned, to name a couple). The food was kicked up versions of typical snack/bar food. The salads were amazing along with the hummus plate. We loved the fresh cut fries and the Margarita Pizza really hit the spot. Portion sizes matched the price and location. <br&gt;<br&gt;My only regret is that the Beach House VT is so far from PA and we only get to Burlington once a year.

I think I would have liked my meal less if forced to pick from each section. The Tartare De Thon Rouge from the first course was quite good and had a lovely presentation. The Tartelette De Poireaux &amp;amp; Pleurottes was our preferred main, again a lovely presentation for this surprisingly savory dish. The Steak Frites was a let-down, definitely the worst item we ordered, the excessive sauce and over done fries were problematic. Luckily the dessert, a Paris-Bres Revisite, proved the best bite of the night. Even if you don&amp;#39;t love dessert it is worth ordering.<br&gt;Quantity: The Prix Fixe Market Menu would have been a very fair amount of food, but we decided to pick and choose.<br&gt;Value: $73 for the Prix Fixe Market Menu, however all the items come a la carte.<br&gt;Ambiance: Bistro De Margot is a traditional upscale restaurant in Burlington. Two large connected rooms, with a bar in the first, and minimal decor. Potentially too bright for the evening, it would have been more romantic dim. The music was extremely quiet pop traditional, which also could be raised a bit to make conversation more reasonable.<br&gt;Crowd: Most of the tables were filled, but it has very limited hours and tables. Reservations are essentially required.<br&gt;Service: Excellent. I felt well taken care of from the moment I entered.<br&gt;Parking: Street parking in the area.",11/3/2022,4
1866,BISTRO DE MARGOT ,"College St, Bur","cocktailbars,french,nightlife,restaurants,seafoo",3,4.5 ,"Y&amp;#39;all, I really wanted to like this place. We were visiting Vermont from Texas and wanted a nice dinner in Burlington. While the service was great, and the wine to compliment with the meal was incredible, the food left much to be desired. We got the prefix menu, which was very expensive for what it ended up being. The food left much to be desired, there was basically no flavor in most of it. Maybe they just had an off night, but I honestly would skip this place unfortunately. The interior is pretty bland and the food was just as flavorless. Again, the service was great, but I recommend choosing just about anywhere else for a nice dinner. We left uninspired and our taste buds unamused.",2/2/2023,3
1867,BISTRO DE MARGOT ,"College St, Bur","cocktailbars,french,nightlife,restaurants,seafoo",3,4.5 ,"Another very enjoyable dinner experience in Burlington VT. We eat out often, but honestly don&amp;#39;t usually choose French restaurants as they can sometimes be a tad stuffy, but I&amp;#39;m happy to say that was not the case here. The restaurant has a strict Covid protocol, which I hope helps everybody feel safer dining, I know we did. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was very good, attentive but not overbearing, and the room was pleasant and comfortable. The oxtail appetizer was delicious, crisp, flavorful and intense. Something you won&amp;#39;t find on every menu. <br&gt;<br&gt;I had pan seared black seabass and it was cooked perfectly, The carrot mousseline on the plate was incredible, the texture was incredibly smooth, I wonder how it is done! The steak frites were also very good. I tried the steak and it was tender, delicious and also perfectly cooked. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our cocktails were delicious, but $18 is certainly on the higher end. The wines were all French, so I did need a little help navigating, and our waitress was helpful in that regard. My only suggestion is that the website menu be refreshed to match what is being offered. We had our heart set on an appetizer, dinner and dessert, and none were available as the menu had changed. I do realize that online menus should only be taken as a guideline, but when you see something that you love, well, it&amp;#39;s a bit of a letdown. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;m certainly glad we dined, and would recommend when in Burlington. I just might be willing to try French restaurants bit more in the future.",11/7/2021,4
1868,BISTRO DE MARGOT ,"College St, Bur","cocktailbars,french,nightlife,restaurants,seafoo",3,4.5 ,"What a pleasurable dining experience! I had wanted to go here but assumed they didn&amp;#39;t allow dogs. We  be were walking by and I figured I&amp;#39;d just ask. They smiled warmly and said they did at their outside tables (huge win for me!) <br&gt;<br&gt;Since I feel everyone wants to know more about the food, I&amp;#39;ll start there. It&amp;#39;s SUPERB! We got a great bottle of red wine from Bordeaux (if you&amp;#39;re into French wine, they have an excellent selection). We got the oxtail and cheese platter as our appetizer. My boyfriend and I were battling over the oxtail and the Barden Blue blue cheese. If you don&amp;#39;t think you like blue cheese, please do yourself a favor and try this. It is creamy, tangy, and nutty and not overpowering or obnoxious like a lot of blue cheeses. The oxtail is juicy and tender and wrapped up delicately in a panko (I think) with some frisée on top and a touch of bourguignonne. Next time we will both be getting our own oxtail. This dish is so delicious it is not to be shared. <br&gt;<br&gt;For our dinners, I had the halibut and he ordered the chicken. You really cannot go wrong with either. My halibut was pan seared and had a nice crispy finish on the outside and moist on the inside. The cauliflower purée complimented it very well and I loved all the veggies it came with. <br&gt;My boyfriend got the chicken, which seriously is the best chicken I can ever remember having! The skin had this delicate crisp to it that tasted magical with the juicy meat. He also had a bunch of veggies (you can never have enough fresh veggies in my opinion!).<br&gt;<br&gt;The service just made this place even better. Our waitress (I wish I could remember her name, but she was from Jersey) was fun and gave us plenty of recommendations for what to do in and around Burlington (we just moved here). The chef even came out to see how we enjoyed the meal and to say hi to our dog! He and his wife have lived and worked all over the world, and he started his restaurant in Burlington when she got a job here. He literally gave me a step by step process on how to recreate his amazing chicken dish! Does that ever happen?! <br&gt;<br&gt;The whole night was so great and we are both really looking forward to going back and trying more on their menu! If you&amp;#39;re looking for a great dinner in Burlington Bistro de Margot is the place to go.",9/18/2021,5
1869,BISTRO DE MARGOT ,"College St, Bur","cocktailbars,french,nightlife,restaurants,seafoo",3,4.5 ,"Classically classy, understatedly romantic, and simply delicious--the perfect for our 12th anniversary dinner.<br&gt;<br&gt;Although there is only indoor seating, Margot diligently observes Covid precautions like social distancing, entryway hand sanitizer, and common-area masking.  When I made the reservation, they asked if we had been vaccinated.  So I felt safe dining indoors for the 1st time in forever.<br&gt;<br&gt;I love the dining room of clean grays, whites, &amp;amp; black with a few bright accents of a &amp;#34;moutarde&amp;#34; yellow to give the place a modern glow.  The staff was friendly without being intrusive, and every need was met before we felt it.<br&gt;<br&gt;The amuse bouche was a lovely asparagus vichyssoise --a cold soup with a base of puréed potatoes and leeks with cream and stock. Not too rich, not too grassy: every ingredient was perfectly proportioned.<br&gt;<br&gt;My husband started with an oxtail crisp sitting pretty in a bright burgundy (?) sauce and topped with frisee.  My husband said he could have eaten half a dozen of these.  The &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; he described like a pastry--a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth-like-butter pastry--filled with braised oxtail.  Now, we don&amp;#39;t know if it actually was braised, but we are big fans of braised meats, so this is high praise.  And that sauce? Plate-lickably delicious.  I would buy a bottle of that and put it on an and everything.<br&gt;<br&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve been craving escargot since before Covid came to town, so I almost wept with joy when I saw it in the menu.  (I was supposed to go Paris last spring, and I&amp;#39;ve bitterly thought about all the escargot, tartare aller-retour , and calves liver I&amp;#39;ve been cheated out of...) And this escargot Bourgogne was textbook perfect.  To my mind, the perfect escargot should simply let a few bold flavors sing out clearly without drowning one another.  The garlic, the parsley, the butter...it was so good that I shamelessly broke up the crust of my bread and squished it into the pan to soak up the extra. I came *this* close to tipping the pan to let it all dribble into my mouth...but the social distancing wasn&amp;#39;t so far apart that I could do this without embarrassing myself, so I refrained.  Just barely. One must maintain some standard of civilized manners in these confusing times...<br&gt;<br&gt;My husband loved his duck.  I asked him what he liked best about it, and he replied, &amp;#34;the fat.&amp;#34;So clearly, you will have to rely on my summation from the small bite I shared from his dish: the fat was indeed perfectly crisp, the meat was to-the-second perfectly cooked (over-cooked duck is the worst!), and the cherry sauce was was the perfect foil for all the well-balanced flavors.  <br&gt;<br&gt;My husband did remark on the remarkable freshness of the spring vegetables--tender-crisp shallots, peas in the pod, carrots and whipped potatoes . He downright loved the cherry sauce.  It would be hard for anyone not to.<br&gt;<br&gt;I ordered the moules frites --musssls steamed in white wine and garlic, but I got the works with cream, chorizo &amp;amp; peppers for a few bucks more.  Now, I love garlicky mussels, but so many times, I&amp;#39;ve been disappointed by vapid mussels in a ho-hum sauce. But Margot has it down to an art.  No need to swallow a spoonful of broth just to make the mussels palatable!  The mussels themselves tasted like they had been injected with garlicky goodness.  And not a single one was overcooked.  And fresh? Oh, yes, so fresh--and I say this with the authority of one who grew up by the ocean!<br&gt;<br&gt;But let&amp;#39;s talk about the fries for a second.  I love the idea of fries, I love the *ideal* of fries...but I never order fries because a girl can only have her heart broken so many times before it won&amp;#39;t mend. But here, all my fry dreams were fulfilled.  Seasoned just right and still crisp and satisfying when the meal was over, these fries were perfection. <br&gt;<br&gt;I kind of wish we had skipped dessert.  The meal had been so dream-like perfect, you know? But we got greedy...<br&gt;<br&gt;My husband&amp;#39;s tarte chocolat menthe with fresh mint custard was good.  The mint custard was light, almost like a whipped cream, and tasted like the freshest mint-infused cream with just a ghost of sweetness--it was magical.  But I found the chocolat tart heavy and overbearing, it&amp;#39;s pastry a bit thick, almost sulky. We both enjoyed the house-made peppermint chocolate chip ice cream--I wish one could order just that for dessert. <br&gt; <br&gt;My tartlette meriguee au citron was, um, tart.  But it&amp;#39;s supposed to be, I get that.  Maybe my southerner&amp;#39;s palate has been spoiled by tooth-achingly sweet ice-box lemon meringue pies, because I almost couldn&amp;#39;t finish this one. I wanted more meringue, I needed more sugar.  And the Meyer lemon sherbert made my mouth pucker and squeal. Others may love it, but it just wasn&amp;#39;t for me.<br&gt;<br&gt;But I will not let a too-tart lemon tartlette stand in the way of my declaring Bistro de Margot to be my new favorite restaurant in the Burlington area.  It even might be my favorite in all of Vermont, but before I decide that, I should visit a few more times.  I&amp;#39;m looking forward to it.",5/28/2021,5

The wait staff are exceptionally skilled and highly knowledgeable. The decor is spare and elegant. <br&gt;<br&gt;The wine selection is unusually high quality, with an emphasis on some of the more important French wine regions. We chose a Chinon rosé (from Loire) with our meal.<br&gt;<br&gt;We began with a small palette cleanser from the chef, which was a gaspacho. It hit all the right notes, The Vermont cheeseboard featured an interesting selection from strong blue cheese, to a mixture of goat/cow, to pure goat cheese, served with lightly toasted hearty bread and a dab of apple chutney. All exquisite.<br&gt;<br&gt;For mains, we both had the lamb cutlets, which were grilled perfectly (rare) and served with a delightfully light sauce and a tower of summer vegetables.<br&gt;<br&gt;To end the meal, we tried the peach tart and the pistachio creme baked pastry. The former was unexceptional, but the pistachio was really outstanding --light and delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;This is a gem of a restaurant for a discerning palate, and when you make reservations, the staff ask if you have been vaccinated, in order to accommodate everyone (unvaccinated are seated out of doors).<br&gt;<br&gt;Bravi on a wonderful addition to Burlington and the region.",8/18/2021,4

Our server was fabulous and recommended the Malbec with my steak - wine I wouldn&amp;#39;t typically have ordered, but she brought me a taste to make sure and she was spot on. <br&gt;And then the dessert - something we usually skip, but after seeing desserts arriving at other tables, we couldn&amp;#39;t refuse. Vanilla crème brûlée and an espresso martini - perfection, and the best way to end a truly exceptional meal. <br&gt;And on top of that, their protocol around social distancing and covid vaccination ensures you feel safe while you are dining.

We are well acquainted with other local offerings, and next time we&amp;#39;ll probably just stick with them instead. <br&gt;<br&gt;I often feel as if takeout licenses an establishment to serve smaller portions than they otherwise might. This was no exception. The already-tiny sauce containers came practically empty (well under a quarter full). The sizes of the veg/side servings and the pasta helping for one of the dishes were also underwhelming. The rabbit was extremely dry. Foie gras and duck dishes were good, on the other hand.

Very den-ish, like i was waking into after-dinner smoking room for gentlemen back in the day with leather chairs and a fireplace. It was so cozy. If I had been in front of the fireplace I might have stayed all night. Our server was great as she was also the hostess AND bartender. Poor thing was doing it all on her own but managing very well. We barely had to wait at all for our drinks. <br&gt;<br&gt;My only complaint is that the two drinks we tried were very weak and the menu selection was a bit odd in my opinion. There were a lot of fruity bourbon options and a few non-bourbon selections (which is great for those who don&amp;#39;t prefer bourbon). Buutttt, it&amp;#39;s called the whiskey room and I could barely taste it in my drink. I was surprised they didn&amp;#39;t have any standard menu sections that were more spirit-forward like the vieux carre, old fashioned, Manhattan, sazerac, etc. There were a few variations of these but none of the standards. Maybe it&amp;#39;s because those are so common they don&amp;#39;t feel they need to put them on the menu and you can just order them on your own? Not sure. I was just surprised.",1/6/2021,4

This was sweet, strong, and so tasty<br&gt;- Bourbon St. Cider- a cocktail drink, with added local apple cider.

He was super knowledgeable and made several awesome recommendations. I was basic and he made me a delicious amaretto sour while my husband had a special cocktail and then a neat pour of whiskey. The whiskey he initially ordered was generic so Michael suggested one of his favorites. My husband went with the suggestion and loved the whiskey! I highly recommend stopping here and only hope you get Michael as your server!",9/4/2020,5
1902,THE WHISKEY ROOM ,Church St,"irish,nightlife,pubs,restaurant",2,4.0 ,"Unfortunately our visit didn&amp;#39;t go great. First I&amp;#39;ll say that the best thing this place has going for it is the room itself. It&amp;#39;s a beautiful spot, very on par for a cocktail bar. But outside of the atmosphere itself, the drinks were pretty terrible. I ordered Bullet over ice and was surprised to see a whiskey bar didn&amp;#39;t have large ice cubes. My wife got a whiskey sour, which was a horrible attempt. Tasted simply terrible. Neither times did the bartender ask what kind of whiskey we wanted. We figured maybe whiskey wasn&amp;#39;t the bartender&amp;#39;s strong suit, and ordered White Russians. I don&amp;#39;t think she knew that White Russians are made with cream, not milk. It was essentially a chocolate milk. Isn&amp;#39;t this a cocktail bar? These are both three ingredient cocktails. My standards for cocktails are not that high, but this was so miserable. Bartender also was very unpleasant, wouldn&amp;#39;t look at people in the eye. Sad. Will look for a better spot next time.  Waste of money.",2/6/2022,2

They had 20 and 40 year old Glenlivet, Glenfidditch, and Macallan. It was a paradise! <br&gt;They also had Pappy Van Winkle available, which is like finding the holy grail of bourbon, and it is priced as so, at $100/pour. <br&gt;<br&gt;The interior of the bar was just lovely. There was a  fireplace that we were lucky enough to sit next to, on a cold night. It has whiskey magazines, and old vintage bottles.

Love trying some of the signature cocktails. I had a jalapeño infused drink I ordered from their drink specials board that was out of this world! Food is top notch, also!

1920,THE WHISKEY ROOM ,Church St,"irish,nightlife,pubs,restaurant",2,4.0 ,First time in the Whiskey room was a lot of fun. I am not a big drinker and especially do not go near the bourbons or whiskeys. I wanted to try something new so I got the Bourbon Bacon drink special which was $10. It wasn&amp;#39;t as good as it sounded in the description. I think the bartender must have over poured because the drink was way to strong and the bacon was on the older side and tasted a bit stale. The next drink I got was something I am very familiar with which was a Vodka soda. It was very good and well made. <br&gt;<br&gt;I loved the inside of the Whiskey room. It was like a nice lounge where you can catch up and get a drink with a friend or where you can go on a nice whiskey date. <br&gt;<br&gt;Something I liked about this place was that it was connected with Riras. I am not sure many people like that but I thought it was great! I had a few drinks at the Whiskey Room then went to Riras with my girlfriend to go and dance! I did not have to stand in a line to get in either which was a plus. <br&gt;<br&gt;I cannot wait to comeback!,1/20/2015,4

I&amp;#39;ve been here multiple times, and always had good service. The bartender and servers don&amp;#39;t seem to split their tips, so make sure you cash out at the bar if you go to a table, and visa versa. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bartenders are also knowledgeable about their drinks, and can help recommend cocktails if you can&amp;#39;t decide. The prices are reasonable, and I believe they have happy hour specials too. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s a great place to grab a drink with friends before or after dinner! Check it out!",1/11/2017,5

However, the Old Fashioned I was made could be the worst I ever had. It does not give me joy to express as, again, the bartender was such a friendly guy. First...crushed ice. That&amp;#39;s a full stop right there. How does a whiskey bar use crushed ice. Next, enough simple sugar to pucker your lips. This drink had more sugar than a come, it was the only flavor that could possibly be tasted. I have to say, avoid the Old Fashioneds or any other classic mix drink.",6/16/2019,2

I have also tried the breakfast burrito, which was really good but I&amp;#39;m still a little partial to the sandwiches. <br&gt;<br&gt;The staff was awesome and the line moved rather fast whenever I stopped by.

My partner had the Italian, a great sandwich as well.<br&gt;In a state with hard to find great sandwiches, this place will fill the void.  The bread was fresh and ingredients were tasty. <br&gt;<br&gt;Highly recommend the sweet jewel of a sandwich shop-",2/11/2022,4

Surprisingly, there was a decent line around 2pm (seems that most were locals and regulars who go there to get there sandwiches). I&amp;#39;m always a fan of fish and chips, but don&amp;#39;t always find great ones as many places have too little fish and too much batter - but Union Jacks gets it right! The fish filet was large and fresh and there was just the right amount of batter so that it&amp;#39;s crispy but not too doughy. The fish inside was tender and juicy! <br&gt;<br&gt;I do have to say that I wasn&amp;#39;t the biggest fan of their chips/fries - there were very thick and almost a bit soggy. I personally prefer crisper fries. Their onion rings, however, were very good! So I would recommend ordering a la cart with a piece of Fish Filet and a side of onion rings!<br&gt;<br&gt;They also seem to have some amazing (and huge if you order the 12&amp;#39; ones) sandwiches - too bad I didn&amp;#39;t have a large enough stomach to try one!",12/26/2017,4

I love fish and chips and I&amp;#39;m from the coast of Maine where fresh is the only way to have your seafood. I have had some iffy fish and chips from places here in Vt, and usually am leery of trying it. I ordered the regular size fish and chips and holy sweet haddock was I in heaven, from the first bite of the just right batter encrusted flakey, tender filet. The chips were fine too,but that fish just made me want to keep eating until I burst! The portion size was phenomenal. You won&amp;#39;t leave hungry that&amp;#39;s for sure!

Went in there and got a classic fish and chips (regular). The service I got when I was ordering/waiting for my food made me feel really good and welcomed. They are doing in-person dining during COVID, and they are handling it extremely well and sanitizing everything regularly. A very clean environment to eat in. Food came out and I was astounded. I have never had better fish and chips in my life. Normally the fish and chips I&amp;#39;ve had were soggy and not crispy at all, but this was not the case. The fish was super crisp and flavorful, and the tartar sauce and malt vinegar made for an ultimate taste experience. The fries and fish were massive and the fries were cooked to perfection. They have fountain drinks, and that accompanied my meal extremely well. I literally (slightly) burnt my mouth because I could not stop eating it. I ended up stuffing myself and was full afterward. After I was finished eating, I went to leave and was given a friendly goodbye from the workers.<br&gt;<br&gt;This place is amazing. There&amp;#39;s absolutely no reason not to go here if you want good fish and chips and astounding service. Would go again.",1/15/2021,5

I had a pastrami on rye with English mustard.  The sandwich was grilled as a Panini and was quite tasty.

We found through our trusty friends on Yelp and we weren&amp;#39;t disappointed!! <br&gt;<br&gt;First off, there was a line, but it moved very quickly. I anticipate it&amp;#39;s a family business and they are truly from the UK by their accents.  Though it was busy, no one seemed rushed when answering our questions. It felt as though they really wanted us to have something we would find delicious.  My boyfriend asked, &amp;#34;onion rings or pickles?&amp;#34; When three separate men in line unanimously shouted &amp;#34;pickles!&amp;#34;, we knew we were in a good, and regular driven, spot. <br&gt; <br&gt;So he went with the staple- fish and chips. Delicious. Wonderful tartar sauce. Fries seemed like they were probably Belgian style. I had the Turkey Lurkey- essentially Thanksgiving in a panini.  The meat and cheese was freshly sliced in front of us. Fried pickles- served with ranch. They were more of stackers than spears, which made them less juicy, and probably a lot easier to eat. Everything was delicious. <br&gt;<br&gt;My favorite thing about all though- how nice everyone was! They all smiled, seemed truly happy to be helping and seemed actually excited when you told them how much you enjoyed their food.

Everything about it different from the original sandwich I reviewed, even the oil they used on these last two smelled harsh, heavy, and extra greasy. So I loved the first time I ordered here, but since it has been consistently a different experience.

Had it delivered so I can&amp;#39;t speak to the in-person vibe, just the food.<br&gt;<br&gt;The mozzarella sticks: my least favorite thing I ordered. Not noteworthy. Same quality, consistency, and flavor as any of the supermarket freeze brands made at home. Not particularly crispy, or melty, or warm. Not great mozz sticks, but not bad. Barnyard still has the best mozzarella sticks.<br&gt;<br&gt;The chicken sandwich: Pretty good. A nice cushy sesame seed bun, shredded lettuce is deep green and good quality, big fresh firm tomato slice. Happy with ingredient quality, and the chicken is crispy and good (real chicken, not spongey) - my one complaint is that the spicy chicken is mild. If not for the slight orange hue to the breading I wouldn&amp;#39;t notice any heat or spicy flavor really. Some sort of spicy mayo or spicy honey would really kick this sandwich up and make it perfect for me, instead of the plain mayo it came with. Decent chicken sandwich though! Damn good for a corner store chicken sandwich, and better than some restaurants in the area. And for $5?! Can&amp;#39;t beat that. <br&gt;<br&gt;The French fries: These surprised me. Fries were a last minute addition to my order and I&amp;#39;m glad I got them. Some of the best fries I&amp;#39;ve had in Burlington. Ruben James fries are the best I&amp;#39;ve found previously, but these might be a tie. The crispy texture, slightly flaky outside, just the right amount of salt, warm and tasty. Seem to be battered and fried perfectly. And for the price?!

The beef patties are thick and heavy and come stacked with a hefty dose of whatever toppings you pick. The chicken sandwiches are made grilled or crispy - with an option for spicy. No matter what you order, it&amp;#39;ll be extremely filling.. and cheap. I think these huge burgers only ran me about $7. <br&gt;<br&gt;So why&amp;#39;d I knock off a star? The service - or rather the lack of. There&amp;#39;s no reliable system in place to get the food to you. The food&amp;#39;s made at the grill, your name is called once (and you better pray you&amp;#39;re there to hear it), and if you don&amp;#39;t scream back in acknowledgement, your food will be put on a rack which is behind the counter and out of sight. When you do arrive or realize you missed your name-call, you&amp;#39;ll have to go around back to the grill and tap the grill-master on his shoulder - potentially throwing off his grilling mojo - and ask for your goods.

The fried pickles were just meh, but my wife dug them, so maybe fried pickles just aren&amp;#39;t my bag.

1998,THE SHOPPING BAG ,North St,"burgers,restaurant",1,4.0 ,"Our first stop after landing in Burlington this past weekend was to hit up The Shopping Bag and get us some burgers. The rest of the shop is basically your standard-issue convenience store, and you do have to order your burger at the regular cashier, but in the other corner is where the sandwiches and burgers get made. We were lucky in that we were there a bit before 11 AM (too early for a burger? Methinks not), so we were the only ones waiting for one at that point. It does take a little time to get the grill and everything else fired up, so be prepared to stand around awkwardly, perusing your cell phone or trying to remember the last time you ate those donuts in the Entemann&amp;#39;s box in front of you. After probably 7-10 minutes, though, we were golden, and it was off to the car to stuff our faces.<br&gt;<br&gt;When I think of how to compare this to some of the more famous fast-casual burger spots, I would say that it has the heft of Shake Shack but the flavor of In-N-Out. In other words, chowing this down - whether it was my Double Doug with bacon (and with cheese, which I had explicitly said not to include - so a bit of a ding for getting my order wrong) or the Sizzler (my wife&amp;#39;s choice) - both are incredibly homey and use simple ingredients (like standard-issue Heinz ketchup or Kraft singles for the cheese) to make a good meal. That, to me, is more what In-N-Out is like. However, you&amp;#39;re not going to enjoy an exquisitely delicious beef patty that you could devour individually, which is what Shake Shack&amp;#39;s patties are like. So while you can fill yourself up for $7 or so, it&amp;#39;s actually at the same price point as a double Shackburger, which I would take any and every day over the burgers here.<br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s something satisfying about hosing patties fresh off the grill and stuffed with just about any condiment you can find (which is what eating The Sizzler felt like), but while it was satisfying, it was not the most flavorful burger I have had. It&amp;#39;s that lack of flavor that would actually drive me to try other burgers in Burlington first before returning here. The burgers are quite solid, but the more I think about it, the less I feel like I had something close to a religious experience (which, in my humble opinion, is what eating the best burgers can be like).",9/6/2017,3

A host seats you snd gives you a menu. Then you go up to the cashier to order, get your own drink. And plates. Each pizza is made to order so it takes a little while to get your food. Our pizza arrived and it looked good!<br&gt;<br&gt;After taking a picture, we dug in. It was hot and the cheese was melty. But for me the flavor was just okay.

I didn&amp;#39;t leave hungry, but I&amp;#39;m not sure It would be my first choice for pizza again. <br&gt;<br&gt;I will say that the place got really busy and the host/cashier was definitely getting his steps in.

I didn&amp;#39;t mind.<br&gt;I came here with 5 people and we ended up ordering 4 large pizzas. We struggled to finish the last 3 slices! The pizza was BOMB. It had a crispy crust, a lot of flavor, and it wasn&amp;#39;t too pricey. For 4 large pizzas plus 18% tip we paid roughly $111.00. We split the bill so it came out to roughly $22 per person. This place is also BYOB so you can bring whatever booze you want. The only downside though is they don&amp;#39;t have ice in the restaurant so come prepared. <br&gt;The food didn&amp;#39;t take too long to come out and the service was great.

Crust was cooked to perfection, you can tell the yeast was set aside to be fermented before it was built into a pie. The ingredients was beyond fresh. <br&gt;<br&gt;The Marinara sauce on the Margherita was lite, not overwhelming with the taste of tomato paste, it was perfectly  seasoned. The cheese was thin enough to break in your mouth for an easy chew. It wasn&amp;#39;t like gum chewy , it was just right. <br&gt;<br&gt;The meatball parm was MY FAVORITE ! The meat portion was a good amount, it was just enough. The pieces of meatball was crumbled, and the chicken parm was cut into small pieces it made it more enjoyable to eat.

I&amp;#39;m a bit of a pizza snob (i.e. like sandwiches, I don&amp;#39;t like ordering food that I can make at home), so we ordered a Detroit pizza to-go.<br&gt;<br&gt;++ They do Detroit style pizza! Makes it worth visiting over any other sit-down pizza shop.<br&gt;+ I liked the cheesy burnt pizza edges<br&gt;+ The bread was nice and puffy, and cheese generous<br&gt;+ The marinara was fresh and a unique recipe<br&gt;+ The ordering and pick-up was seamless, easy, and exact<br&gt;- For a meat lovers pizza, the meat was a little hidden underneath the layers of cheese. Since Detroit is heavy on the cheese, I think they should up the meat ratio.<br&gt;- I&amp;#39;m also a marinara snob -- very few fits the bill for me. Their marinara appeared to be tomato paste/sauce-based with a lot of Italian herbs -- my preference is more whole/chopped tomato-based (let those tomatoes sing!) with less sugar or masking spices added.<br&gt;- Given the pan constraints of a Detroit, perhaps the wood-fired baking that is this restaurant&amp;#39;s highlight is lost on deep dish.<br&gt;-- Value for money! For $17, I would have expected a 4x2 instead of the small 3x2. This size pizza could feed 2-3 but for the price would expect it to feed 3-4.<br&gt;<br&gt;For the price, I think I would find this more rewarding to eat in a dine-in experience.

They are crispy and salty and savory and oh so delicious.  I also has their pork dumpling. Fair warning, their dumplings are huge! (Compared to a traditional dim sum dumpling). The wrapper is chewy and crispy and the filling was so tasty. I also had the cold sesame noodles in peanut since. These were my least favorite dish, I felt it could have used a little more salt, but it was still a solid dish that I&amp;#39;d be happy to eat any day. They have a small indoor seating area but some nice outdoor benches outside. <br&gt;<br&gt;Also, their unique sweet cranberry dipping sauce is delicious!<br&gt;<br&gt;I forgot to take pictures of the food but got a picture of the newly painted mural outside near the seating area",7/18/2022,5

2057,HONG’S CHINESE DUMPLINGS ,Pearl St,"chinese,foodstands,restaurant",1,4.5 ,"TLDR; I&amp;#39;d like to know I&amp;#39;m being charged a fair price before I order and they couldn&amp;#39;t give me a clear answer. Customer service felt bad, and left me feeling bad. The dumplings weren&amp;#39;t rolled or sealed right. Pork filling was good but everything else about the dumplings weren&amp;#39;t. <br&gt;------------------------<br&gt;<br&gt;I asked on the phone how much do 18 dumplings cost because it isn&amp;#39;t clear how they charge. It&amp;#39;s important to me because a difference of 2-3$ is significant. Charging me for 8+10 dumplings costs different from if they charged me 6+6+6 dumplings. But both are 18 dumplings. <br&gt;<br&gt;17$ + 14$ = $31 Which is 10 dumplings plus 8 dumplings. <br&gt;$31 x 11% = $3.41 (Not sure why food sales tax is 11%) <br&gt;$31 + $3.41 = $34.41 = total<br&gt;<br&gt;I was charged 6 dumplings three times, I suppose since I got three different dumplings. The menu clearly states it&amp;#39;s ANY # dumplings, so why do they make the decision if I am charged for a set of 6 three times vs if I&amp;#39;m charged a set of 10 plus a set of 8 for a total of 18? <br&gt;<br&gt;Another issue I have with this is that the online menu says 6 dumplings is $10 when on the phone and in the receipt I was charged $11 per 6 dumplings. This is a $3 difference. <br&gt;$11 x 3 = $33<br&gt;$33 x 11% = $3.63<br&gt;$33 + 3.63 = $36.63 = total<br&gt;VS <br&gt;$10 x 3 =$30<br&gt;30 + $3.30 (sales tax) = $33.30 = total<br&gt;<br&gt;If I&amp;#39;m getting 18 dumplings the price shouldn&amp;#39;t be different between how I get charged. Most customers would want to feel that if they bought more dumplings they would be charged less for buying a lot. <br&gt;Also, when I talked to 3 different people on the phone trying to get a straight answer, I didn&amp;#39;t really feel as if they cared about my question. <br&gt;--------------------------------<br&gt;On the topic of dumplings, I was pretty disappointed for nearly 1.8$ per dumplings. Sure, they&amp;#39;re big, but the wrappers weren&amp;#39;t rolled evenly, and they weren&amp;#39;t folded closed properly. One half of my dumpling wrapper was about a cm thick! The fillings (I got veggie, and the cream cheese) are ok, except the pork, which was very good. <br&gt;*---------------*<br&gt;I kept in mind as I thought about this that she&amp;#39;s training people right now, but this wasn&amp;#39;t what I hoped for as a customer.

What I got was easily double the portion I was expecting. That&amp;#39;s not a bad thing, because i couldn&amp;#39;t get enough. The dough is a little thicker than you might expect, but that&amp;#39;s because it was just rolled out by hand.

The tablewear is chic and unique and the energy is unlike no other in the Burlington area.<br&gt;However, this does not make up for the lack of flavor and lack of uniqueness in the food and drinks.<br&gt;<br&gt;The drinks are expensive and below subpar. There is no unique alcohol mixtures, very basic and boring. The alcohol choices as well are pretty awful. Lairds? Lol. Ok..<br&gt;Next, the food is just plain out depressing due to the lack of flavor.<br&gt;<br&gt;The carrot dumplings were not dumplings at all; simply imagine a ravoli overcooked with mashed carrot with a plain sauce and a weird flower on it.<br&gt;did not do anything to the dish and actually was just a waste of space on a plate. Next time; I would season the vegetables more, as we all know that vegetables are bland unless seasoned correctly, and invest in a good side sauce if offerred. This was not a dumpling sauce at all and the flower does bot do anything but take away from the dish.<br&gt;<br&gt;The Kale Gratin was great due to the cheese, but was it insane? No because it&amp;#39;s just melted cheese and kale in a ramekin: I think anyone can do that.<br&gt;<br&gt;Felt like a waste of money at the end of the meal to the point where we had to leave to grab an actual dish of food. <br&gt;<br&gt;I hope this place advances the quality and taste of their food and makes more effort to understand the vegetables flavors.<br&gt;<br&gt;Seevice was great though; everyone was super super super nice and it elevated the experience.",3/25/2023,2
2080,PARADISO HIFI LOUNGE ,Pine St,"arts,izakaya,lounges,musicvenues,nightlife,restaurant",ul,3.5 ,"The fact that they don&amp;#39;t put their name over the door was probably a bad omen. We started by ordering the deviled duck egg and the pickles. I have to admit that the pickles were good but, oh boy, let me tell about the egg. The yolk is mixed with squid ink and the piped back into the white. Unfortunately, the resulting appearance is that of a dog turd in snow. Still, I&amp;#39;ve had some dishes that looked awful but ended up quite tasty. That wasn&amp;#39;t the case here. The squid ink flavor overwhelmed the egg, making for a fishy, gloopy mess. I couldn&amp;#39;t get past that first bite. When I told the waiter to take away the dish, he asked why and told him. He seemed insulted so we decided to cut our losses and find a new restaurant. The waiter still charged me for the deviled egg ($13!), which struck me as kind of petulant. Save your time, money, and taste buds.",3/24/2023,1

Just put a sign on the door.<br&gt;2. The space, music, and service were exceptional.<br&gt;3. Only 1 NA offering for Dry January? A missed opportunity to be creative.<br&gt;4. A new menu was in effect on the night we went. We&amp;#39;re adventurous diners but struggled to find anything that sounded good. The chips tasted like they were fried in the same oil as the seafood meals. The root vegetable donuts were more like tough pretzel balls, undercooked, and hard to get down. While I truly applaud efforts at new, elevated tastes in town (and was relieved no local cheeses were presented on the ubiquitous gray slate platter) this menu needs more attention at this price point.",1/6/2023,2

The unique music really amplified the vibes, and was different from the &amp;#34;top 40s&amp;#34; music often played at area restaurants.

I tried the maple ale (delicious, but very sweet) and the fish and chips which honestly were great.<br&gt;<br&gt;The seating was a little cramped but the service was quick and friendly. We only found out after that it&amp;#39;s the oldest pub in Vermont, so I would definitely go back again and ask a little bit more about the history.",3/21/2023,5

When I first came here my boyfriend and I got some drinks and a quick meal. Nothing special but good enough that we came back when we were in town. <br&gt;<br&gt;This most recent time however was not great.  It was around noon on a Sunday so a little busy but not crazy busy as there were open tables. We sat outside (big mistake) there were bees everywhere! This of course was not the establishments fault but our own for choosing to sit outside. Instead it was the service we were disappointed in. We waited almost 20 minutes before anyone approached us. We quickly ordered beers and pretzels (which were good). We were planning to order a meal but instead sat another half hour with no service, which wouldn&amp;#39;t have been a big deal if the waitress wasn&amp;#39;t helping everyone else besides us. Instead we got the check and left.",10/17/2022,3

The atmosphere was a bit weird. Half a sports bar but not fully. Half a pub/tavern but not really. They only had a few TV&amp;#39;s and all the beers on tap we were told are made in house. I tried a few sours but neither was great. The amber ale was good, but not great. We didn&amp;#39;t try the food as we were going to dinner after, but I got a glance of the burger which did look good.  Was a bit strange that the place was literally empty just two hours before the Super Bowl. I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s not a local favorite, as it seems much more touristy. Also the chatter among employees and manager barking off instructions to employees was a bit off putting.",2/13/2023,4

Unlike the other locations which were just breweries outside of town, this place had more of a restaurant vibe and was in the city - making it a perfect last stop for those who wanted to continue their night out. .<br&gt;<br&gt;We started downstairs with the tour of the facility - it was crammed but cool to see. We made our way up for the main event.  Rather than making our own  flights, the table was prepared with several pours of a few brews. Nothing stood out as far as the drinks are concerned but the staff was friendly. In fact I left my purse here and they were kind enough to not just set it aside, but they allowed me back in after closing to pick it up.",3/19/2022,3

Had a couple of their beers and their pretzel bites. Beers were pretty good (taste is subjective) and of the two I had indef enjoyed the Czech Pils Over their hazy ipa. The pretzel bites were good but nothing special. I am giving them 4 stars bc their servers and hosts were excellent and as friendly as could be to me and to my two dogs who were quite thirsty.

I did notice however that one of our waiters just left our food/drinks at the small corner table that I assumed was present for social distancing measures, and our other waiter actually made more of an attempt to get the food to the specific individuals within our party and ensure that we all got the right orders--which I really appreciated! <br&gt;<br&gt;The staff was very nice and helpful, and all of our food/drinks were quite generously portioned! There is a variety of options on the menu and I really enjoyed my meal. Note that a party of 5 or more will have 18 percent gratuity already included in the check, but I found the prices to be affordable and consistent with similar options in the area.

With Covid regulations, guests still are asked to wear their masks at the table when the waitstaff is taking orders or delivering food. This seems like a bit much considering the high numbers of vaccinated Vermonters in May 2021, but nevertheless we complied. Our waitress was friendly and the forbidden fruit beer was sweet and sour and had a fresh taste. I ordered the fish and chips: it was a large piece of thick and crispy-battered white fish, with fries, coleslaw, and tartar sauce. The coleslaw was creamy and tangy, with great seasoning. Check out their outdoor patio area for the summer, I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a cool vibe. For a wide selection of beers and pub food, check out Vermont Pub &amp;amp; Brewery.",5/28/2021,4

Our reservation was at 7 and it was a busy, rainy Saturday night, so we didn&amp;#39;t mind. <br&gt;<br&gt;We waited an hour and a half for our food to arrive. The most frustrating part about the wait was that smaller groups of 2-4 / people sitting at the bar who arrived 30mins to an hr after us would receive food before us. <br&gt;<br&gt;Our group ordered chowder, salads, mozzarella sticks, burgers, poutine and Mac and cheese. The chowder arrived promptly.  Caesar salad was good but the added measly $5 of chicken was not worth it (which arrived on a side plate, as they forgot to add it). Cobb salad had slimy red lettuce (salad mix that&amp;#39;s been sitting around past it&amp;#39;s prime date). The guys enjoyed their burgers which were cooked perfectly. Poutine was good as other reviewers mentioned. Mac and cheese was bland. <br&gt;<br&gt;THE MOST MADDENING PART: When asked why our food arrived after other parties who most definitely arrived after us.

Got the combination momo appetizer, which comes with 4 of each type of momo (beef, chicken, veggie). All three momos were delicious! The sauce they come with was also great but honestly, they didn&amp;#39;t need sauce because they were so flavorful on their own. Also tried the vegetable pakora. It comes with two pieces of perfectly fried, well-seasoned pakoras with two types of sauce drizzled on the plate. Again, like with the momos, both sauces were really nice but the pakoras stand perfectly well on their own. For the entree, went with the lamb curry, which was also fantastic. It was moderately spicy (they didn&amp;#39;t ask for a spice level), definitely not distracting from the overall flavor, the lamb was very tender, rice was fairly well-cooked. My only critique is that I wish there was more lamb in the curry (there were 5 pieces). Service was prompt and very friendly.

Our group got stuck in rerouted traffic and arrived to find our table had been given away since we were not there in 15 minutes. We called multiple times to let the staff know, but no one picked up the phone and the voicemail was full.

We ended up eating here anyway as the other restaurants nearby were filled; it was over an hour after our initial reservation that we were seated. <br&gt;<br&gt;I happened to be seated near the counter and heard the phone ringing throughout our meal; it seemed to be working, but the staff was just not picking up. I understand fully that things are very busy and a small staff may not get every call, but I did not appreciate being told &amp;#34;the phones weren&amp;#39;t working&amp;#34; when they very obviously were.

The chips to start were decent but the salsa and guac were really underwhelming. I&amp;#39;ve had much better chips and salsa/guac at many other Mexican restaurants. Out of the tacos, the carnitas was probably the better of the two. Although both were just average. The chorizo rice bowl had way too many beans and not enough chorizo. And the chorizo itself, I wasn&amp;#39;t a fan of. Finally, the passion fruit margarita was actually pretty good~ probably the best thing we got, mainly because they put a lot of tequila in it!! It was pretty strong! Even though it says &amp;#39;for two&amp;#39; it comes in one bottle which was a little deceiving at first, but it&amp;#39;s definitely enough! <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall I definitely don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ll be back.

Regardless, they are still doing their thing and providing great experiences to their customers. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered the chips+salsa+guac starter, the Caliente Margaritas (for 2) to go, and then a taco plate for each of us. We both got the fried fish and shredded chicken tacos, while I got the carnitas taco as well. Each of the dishes made it home without being soggy or coming undone as some dishes can do in transit. The fish was still super crispy, the sauces and toppings didn&amp;#39;t bleed all through the containers, and the food was still hot (not just warm). Each of the tacos boasted a different set of toppings that enhanced the meat and the freshly made corn tortillas that wrapped them up like a warm blanket on a cold, winter night (which... oddly enough, describes the night we ordered them). <br&gt;<br&gt;The food is done well, travels well, is spiced fantastically, and the staff is super friendly (at least for takeout). The only thing that perhaps docked the star was the value paid for the food. While I do not think it was significantly overpriced, the margaritas to go were about 8-10oz for $20 which seems more like Boston prices than Burlington. We didn&amp;#39;t feel like we were slighted for what we paid, but it wasn&amp;#39;t a great value... which isn&amp;#39;t to say I wouldn&amp;#39;t return (I would), but if I&amp;#39;m looking for a value I don&amp;#39;t know that this is where I would go.

However, my friends and I had a reservation for 7:00 and were not seated until 7:15 even though our table was cleared and prepped when we got there which confused us? Then our server was completely rude and inconsiderate when taking our order. She barely looked at us and was very clearly annoyed when we asked a question about the menu.

I have been curious about this spot since i got to Burlington, as it is so lovely inside, and its reputation as a part of the farmhouse grouping exceeds it. I got a carnitas burrito. The service was quick and efficient, the burrito was well prepared, the pineapple salsa was delicious; but ultimately everything was overshadowed by the amount of grease in the carnitas. It soaked through the back of the tortilla, got all over my hands, and created a literal pool of fat on my plate. I have never had carnitas that fatty before and to be honest it was a little gross to see. it held a burrito with high potential, back from greatness.",10/17/2021,2

They followed all guidelines for Covid that made us feel very safe.<br&gt;<br&gt;We were able to reserve a table outside with the nicest waiter. I started off with a blood orange margarita (so tasty) and we ordered the salsa, queso and guacamole. All the dips were delicious and there was no shortage of chips. For dinner my boyfriend got the chorizo and carnitas tacos with rice and beans. Both tacos were very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I had the chicken quesadilla and it was delicious.

Service was quick and the workers were also very friendly!<br&gt;<br&gt;There&amp;#39;s a diverse array of classic dishes on the menu (the American favorites of pan-Asian cuisine, such as pho, sushi, orange chicken), so you&amp;#39;re guaranteed to find something familiar. This is a small restaurant trying to cater to a large variety of Asian dishes, so be prepared that the dishes you order might not be the prepared exactly the way you&amp;#39;re used to. For example, if you order bubble tea, you might receive it in a can (with a crystal boba texture rather than the classic tapioca pearls). When we came, the pho noodle soup we received had broccoli in it, which I&amp;#39;ve certainly never seen before! All of that being said, everything tasted good - the dish you receive just might not be the exact manifestation of what you expect.<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend trying something that you haven&amp;#39;t had before when you come here, which shouldn&amp;#39;t be hard, given the variety of the menu.

Everything has been fantastic and the price is a great deal for the quality of the food. I do think it&amp;#39;s important to note that the crab Rangoon here is a different shape than you typically find so you don&amp;#39;t get the huge amount of filling that you tend to see. I personally really like it because it&amp;#39;s more crunchy than a mouthful of sweet goo.

Overall a great little spot for Thai food in Burlington, with plenty of gluten free options and a nice location. My review has gone down a little because I&amp;#39;ve had a number of times in which orders have been messed up, with the most notable occasion being when an order was delayed because of an error, then I still received the incorrect order (shrimp instead of tofu). This has only happened a few times and only on Fridays (which seem to be their busiest days) so I&amp;#39;m not too upset, but it&amp;#39;s been enough times to be noticeable. Other than that though the service is solid and the food is great. Definitely recommend the Pad Thai, red curry, and Thai fried rice--and again, the gluten free safety precautions and wide variety of gf items is much appreciated an puts this above other Thai places for gluten free eating.",9/9/2022,4

I was always curious to try CNX, which moved into the same convenient location, but when I initially called it sounded like my Celiac (highly sensitive reaction to gluten) couldn&amp;#39;t be accommodated. Recently, I checked again out of curiosity and saw that a number of the items on their menu now had a checkmark with &amp;#34;gluten free,&amp;#34; so I called to see if it would be safe for people with severe gluten intolerance/allergies. I was pleased to hear that cooking surfaces and equipment are cleaned/switched out for each dish and order they make! I tested it out with an order pad thai and very happy to say that not only was it safe for my stomach, but it was delicious! It warmed my heart greatly to have an awesome Thai place nearby again.

I know kitchens aren&amp;#39;t the sun-shiniest workplaces, but to chastise someone like that in front of customers absolutely crosses the line.<br&gt;<br&gt;Was expecting wide, flat rice noodles. These more closely resembled fettuccine in size and taste, and al dente is not exactly appetizing in a pad dish. It was also far too dry and skimping protein. <br&gt;<br&gt;TO BE CLEAR my issue is not necessarily with the restaurant or it&amp;#39;s management--just the gentleman who was working the line tonight.

Their version is watery so extremely sweet (more like dessert) that I couldn&amp;#39;t eat it. if you frequented the previous Thai place just be aware this is different (maybe more Americanized?

The tofu was a great addition and made it just hearty enough to be a full meal, since it would have been a little small otherwise. My friends LOVED the crunchwrap supreme, which is one of their specialties. Great combination of flavors and textures thanks to the cashew queso and so the &amp;#34;n&amp;#39;avo&amp;#34; sauce.

We were heading there for a late lunch about 40 mins before they closed and they had already started to run out of a lot of things on the menu. When we got there the food ultimately took quite a while longer to get ready, realized that they were also accepting walk in orders and they seemed to be really busy. In any case, I guess they have to be extra careful with everything these days so the wait wasn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal.<br&gt;<br&gt;We had a large order and the food when it came was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the korean bbq burger with the lentil patty (which was perfectly crunchy) and the kimchi provided just the right amount of kick. The nachos were fantastic as well and were the first to disappear. We got all 3 kinds of dogs but although the trimmings were excellent a few people were not fans of the hickory smoked carrot used in lieu of the sausage, I didn&amp;#39;t mind them but I figured they&amp;#39;d offer them with an option of vegan sausage as well. The karma shawarma was also good. I love what they are trying to do with vegetarian/vegan takes on quintessential american staples and the place is definitely worth a visit when in the Burlington area.",10/13/2020,4

It was such a nice way to enjoy the summer sunshine!<br&gt;<br&gt;The food itself was delicious. The crunch wrap was super tasty and came with a chipotle aioli that was good, although not as spicy as I usually would have liked. The Not Avocado Toast was also very good.

Expect mouthwatering and rustic-looking desserts piled high on the counter, soups (whodathunkit), and a veggie-filled buffet (pay by the weight). The buffet boasts tofu and tempeh dishes along with simple veggies options like beets, build-your-own salads, wax beans, etc. All delicious. (a few could have used an extra wink of salt)<br&gt;<br&gt;One of my favorite features of Stone Soup is the cozy layout with tables tucked directly against the pull up garage door window on the front wall facing the street.

Praise especially for vegan potatoes au gratin, seitan stew, and super tabbouli. Daily soups also looked good, as did their selection of baked goods. <br&gt;<br&gt;However, the buffet is priced really high. I made a salad thinking it would be light and not cost much, and it ended up being $17. The day I went, they also had no menu options that were both vegan &amp;amp; GF.

2378,BLUE CAT CAFE & WINE BAR ,Lawson Ln,"nightlife,restaurants,steak,wine_bar",3,3.5 ,"I decided to go out to dinner after going to an art show earlier in the evening. I saw that Yelp had a $40 for $20 deal at this restaurant and their menu looked pretty phenomenal, so I thought I would check it out.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s tucked away in a building behind St Paul Street ; it&amp;#39;s quite an intimate and cozy little spot. There were a few tables of diners, mostly couples, when I arrived.<br&gt;<br&gt;The bartender was very friendly and I asked if I could sit at the bar and have dinner, to which she warmly said yes. I had already seen the menu online and knew what I wanted, so I ordered immediately.<br&gt;<br&gt;She brought me a small plate of fresh hummus and warm pita to start. She said it was the restaurant&amp;#39;s version of bread and butter. :) The hummus was creamy and light with a hint of lemon. The warm pita helped scoop up every delightful bite.<br&gt;<br&gt;I then had the Bloody Mary Shrimp Cocktail. The sauce was to be infused with pepper vodka, but it tasted like normal cocktail sauce to me. Still quite good.<br&gt;<br&gt;My main dish was the Magrette Duck Breast. It was described as being served &amp;#34;stuffed with bourbon cherry compote, seared, and served over mashed sweet potato with smoked maple demi-glace.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;The potatoes I received were white and the breast was not stuffed, but the dish was gloriously swimming in a compote and peppercorn sauce sauce. I did not taste the Demi-glace, if it was used. I tasted instead a more traditional peppercorn sauce mixed with the compote. It was served with a side of savory mushroom duxelles. <br&gt;<br&gt;That said, the dish was delicious. The duck was a perfect medium rare, as I&amp;#39;d requested. The duxelles was also very good.<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s quite possible that as I&amp;#39;d arrived around 7:50 and the restaurant was to close at 8:30, that the kitchen opted to put a twist on my dish as the other ingredients were not at the ready. I sincerely appreciate their creativity, as it did not detract from the dish. That said, I was really looking forward to eating the dish as written, so I was a little disappointed. <br&gt;<br&gt;The bartender was friendly throughout and the service was excellent. <br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d definitely return here at an earlier time to try some of the other items on the menu.

I felt as if we had stepped into an old story! <br&gt;<br&gt;The menu was simple, we ordered salads and a cheese plate, three filets, and an order of lamb. At 8:10 pm we got our appetizers... yes we walked in at 6:30 pm and waited an hour and a half for 3 salads and a cheese plate... we had to ask the waitress what was going on numerous times and it was obviously a situation beyond her control. I actually felt bad for her. However, at some point she should have come over to our table and explained the situation.  When we asked she said a diner had celiac and they had to sanitize everything before making her meal and that put them behind... i personally cannot imagine that would take that long... but still, we sat there waiting for an answer for over an hour.  Appetizers came and the salads were mediocre however the cheese board was phenomenal! Then dinner came around 25 mins later.  The lamb was delicious! The filets were bland and unseasoned. One was extremely undercooked, one was cold, and the other was devoured by my compadre that hadn&amp;#39;t eaten all day and just didn&amp;#39;t care anymore.  When asked about the steak we were told 20 mins for another one. <br&gt;<br&gt;We opted to get the check and get out. They did give us two slices of pie for free and knock off some of thw bill. The catch was, the owner was the cook, and when we asked to speak to her about our situation she told our waitress that she was &amp;#34;too busy&amp;#34;. Our bill was still around 200 dollars, the food was definitely not worth the money and the experience was one of the worst I have ever experienced.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!",3/6/2021,1

Noticing the disappointment, our waiter/bartender (Maria) took initiative to notify the chef. The head chef, Maria Shaw, took the time to visit our table &amp;amp; provide recommendations on local places that did serve duck as an entrée. The staff was beyond remarkable; I can&amp;#39;t speak highly of them enough, they were gracious, personable, &amp;amp; prompt! We ultimately decided to dine in.

The food was fresh but it took forever to get to us and the presentation was lacking. I wish this restaurant luck, they are trying and need to do better.",2/13/2022,2

The bartender was phenomenal and a great communicator he made the experience a five stars night. The sushi was fresh and flavorful. It was a place that I would go back to and recommend to anyone.,1/23/2022,5
2431,SUSHI MAEDA ,Cherry St,"japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,"To be fair, the food was okay. The experience? not so much. I called and ordered dinner for my family right before I left Williston. Over $130 worth of food for me and kids. I was quoted 30 minutes lead time. When I arrived 30 minutes later on the dot, the order was not ready. Sure not a big deal, right? Well, it actually took over another hour to get my order! I was pretty close to cancelling it a few times. But kids had their hopes up for sushi. So I sucked it up and waited. When I got home, a lot of the items I ordered were missing from the bag. Ugh! I called the restaurant and they confirmed that the order was not complete, and that they had tried to call me back. To their credit my phone does have a record of that incoming call when I was driving. So I went back to get the rest of the food. Had to double park on Cherry Street this time. To my shock, the food was not ready! I tried to keep an eye on my car, but it got ticketed while I waited for a good 15 minutes. Granted it was my fault to double park. When I complained to Nick the manager, he agreed to pay for the ticket. To be honest, if he didn&amp;#39;t agree, I would have returned the food. Fast forward to 2 months later, I received a notification of the unpaid parking ticket in the mail, along with a fine on top of the original amount. I called the restaurant and spoke to Nick. He remembered the incident right away, however he insisted that the restaurant could not be responsible for my double parking. You would think Nick could have at least called me to let me know that before I incurred the fine. I don&amp;#39;t need to eat there ever again. Terrible service and manager&amp;#39;s words and integrity are worth less than $88.",8/11/2022,1

Although there were a handful of empty tables , the guy behind the bar only offered us to either sit between 2 other parties (too close in my opinion ,<br&gt;It was almost shoulder to shoulder) or at a high seated table which was located in an awkward centered location. Those kinds of seats are not comfortable especially for a woman of my size and I like to be comfortable when I&amp;#39;m eating. <br&gt;<br&gt;I asked if we could sit at another table and he said no. Offered no other options. Not even outside seating or maybe offer us to wait. I felt as if they didn&amp;#39;t need us to come eat and spend our money there anyway. <br&gt;<br&gt;If tables are clearly available , you should let customers come in , not wait for ghost customers to maybe show up to fill them up.

I went here via recommendation from a local friend but was honestly skeptical getting served by what appeared to be an all-white staff. Typical Vermont, though, to be fair. I was quite impressed. In also typical Vermont fashion, everyone was friendly and welcoming. As for the food, the broth was quite good. I got the chicken shoyu ramen, subbing chicken with tofu and adding spicy kick + black garlic. The broth was savory yet light, the tofu was fried well, and the garlic and spice just elevated the dish to the next level. Truly the garlic... The noodles were thick and fine. My criticism was I wish more toppings than the main protein, egg, and scallions were included. Other ramen places in DC and NYC are more generous, typically including things like nori, fishcake, and/or corn without extra fees.<br&gt;<br&gt;My spouse had the miso ramen with pork chashu. It came with thin noodles. A thicker broth. He liked it as well but preferred my noodles. I may have preferred *his* noodles.<br&gt;<br&gt;We came here on a Friday for lunch in August, shortly after it first opened that day. Unlike other reviewers, i found the service to be good on our day. The ramen did seem to take longer than usual to come out, but not to the point where I would complain, and the food was nice and hot.<br&gt;<br&gt;Decor props were kinda stereotypical japanese samurai swords and such. The art along the back wall is quite cool and different. Spacious for social distancing, plenty of natural light from the window wall facing the main street. <br&gt;<br&gt;To the reviewer who said &amp;#34;gaku&amp;#34; doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything in Japanese or Chinese, it means several things in Japanese: picture frame, learning/scholarship/knowledge.

There were pieces of raw onion in it and the noodles were all clumped together and not very fresh.<br&gt;<br&gt;What I did like was the appetizers, if you want good drinks and a few appetizers this is the place to go.

2444,GAKU RAMEN ,Church St,"ramen,restaurant",2,3.0 ,"We ate here for lunch and sat outside. An appetizer of Gaku Buns with pork, entrees of Chicken Shoyu Ramen and Pork Belly Rice Bowl, all of which we shared. <br&gt;<br&gt;Service was on the slow side after ordering. The drinks came fairly soon but the food took too long and the appetizer and entrees arrived together. I&amp;#39;d be more understanding if the place was busy but it was not. I don&amp;#39;t fault the servers for this though; they were mostly attentive and personable.<br&gt;<br&gt;Gaku buns were simple: just a piece of seasoned pork wrapped with a soft doughy bun. We liked them. I did have to locate soy sauce though from another table.<br&gt;<br&gt;The ramen was unimpressive: the broth lacked complexity, seemed &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34; in flavor. The onions were raw and cut too large. The chicken,  though there wasn&amp;#39;t really enough of it, was good: not dry at all and was probably thigh not breast which I&amp;#39;m not a fan of. <br&gt;<br&gt;The rice bowl was fried rice with scallions, shiitake mushrooms, corn, and more, with the pork belly prepared as a single slice on top. The pork itself was quite good: not overly fatty but far more interesting than a leaner cut. But as with the ramen the meat portion was too small. At first I liked this dish. But as I continued to eat I began to notice the oilyness of the rice, which became more objectionable as it cooled.<br&gt;<br&gt;My drink: a cocktail made with tequila, grapefruit, and cinnamon. Interesting; I&amp;#39;ve never had that combination before. Plenty of tequila. Her drink: prosecco. What can I say? Prosecco. Bubbly. Refreshing.<br&gt;<br&gt;&amp;#34;Make It Spicy - 0.50&amp;#34;?

Trust me, you&amp;#39;ll be much happier.<br&gt;<br&gt;I got the kaarage which is the fried chicken and as someone else in the reviews mentioned they were unseasoned, unimpressive and very much like Chicken McNuggets. What appalled me even more though, was that they were served with aioli. Really? Sambal Mayo?? So inauthentic and also totally gross.<br&gt;<br&gt;I also ordered the black garlic tonkotsu. The broth had zero flavor, was oily and the concept of umami was as apparent as a rainbow is to a dog.<br&gt;<br&gt;The noodles were way over cooked, had zero bounce, the meat was so thinly cut, like deli meat, I would&amp;#39;ve been upset except it was all fat and really just a travesty of two protein slices sitting on the saddest bowl of ramen ever created.<br&gt;<br&gt;There was no soft boiled egg, I suppose the mushroom and bamboo were fine but I&amp;#39;m sure they came from a jar so hard to mess that up.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will say that the service, once they finally approached the table, was fine, but the lag between hello and the food was far too long.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I get why this place is crowded because, I mean, ramen!

2546,A SINGLE PEBBLE ,Bank St,"chinese,noodles,restaurants,seafoo",4,3.5 ,"After hearing about what was supposed to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Burlington, VT I eagerly made reservations as soon as they were available. At long last, the night had arrived and we made our way to A Single Pebble. Honestly, I wanted to love this place so bad but my experience just wasn&amp;#39;t the greatest.<br&gt;<br&gt;I liked the design of the place okay and thought the downstairs seating area with the outside patio in view was kind of cool. I suppose the Lazy Susans on each table are not something you see every day but the food itself just wasn&amp;#39;t what I anticipated.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will say, the beef wontons were good. They were fried well, hot and paired together well with the ginger vinegar sauce included. The filling inside was quite flavorful as well. My main complaint was with the mock eel (mushrooms) we ordered which was extremely (and I mean extremely) salty. <br&gt;<br&gt;The dish itself was marred by the amount of pure saltiness in each bite, very offputting to say the least. We also had the water beef which seemed to be just that, blandly seasoned vegetables and beef in a dish full of hot water. We were told the presentation was beautiful but the taste hardly reflected that. <br&gt;<br&gt;I suppose I&amp;#39;ll end on a good note and say that our final dish, the tangerine peel chicken, was quite good. Each piece of chicken was well seasoned and tasted sweet and tangy. This is the dish I would probably go back to if I ever went back to A Single Pebble but honestly, save your money and order in somewhere else. <br&gt;<br&gt;Overall, I was disappointed, especially after paying almost $100 for what I considered subpar, overly salty, and at the same time underseasoned food.",9/21/2021,2

However, the only thing that stood out there was the service, which was amazing. All other aspects were underwhelming. <br&gt;<br&gt;My partner and I were in Burlington for a special occasion so when we went here we opted to splurge and go with the 9 course tasting menu which is $50 a person. It started off with an handful of pickled carrots which we didn&amp;#39;t even realize was a course at first. It got better from there but not much. The remaining courses ranged from fine to bland and the portions were small. I didn&amp;#39;t expect to be hungry at the end of a 9 course meal but neither of us were satiated so we ordered some dumplings. Those were honestly better than anything else we had but no better than the steamed dumplings you get at an average Chinese restaurant.

I have also LOVED dining at A Single Pebble for at least 15 years now. Mock eel and green beans are favorites, and the hot and sour soup makes you realize that you can never again have that from a generic Chinese restaurant.<br&gt;<br&gt;Why 3 stars? I got takeout recently while staying in a hotel for a staycation. I ordered something new, Ants Climbing a Tree. This dish is delicious flavor-wise, and I love a good cellophane noodle dish. HOWEVER, the pepper that was used is SO GRITTY that I had to call the restaurant and ask &amp;#34;is it possible the mushrooms were still dirty? It is too gritty to eat. Can you ask the kitchen?&amp;#34; In response to this question, the person I was speaking to said &amp;#34;Oh, yeah, we get asked that a lot. It isn&amp;#39;t dirt, it is just the pepper we use that is super fine.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;So, my question is... if people often ask &amp;#34;Hey, is this dirt in my dish or...?&amp;#34; why do they still use this pepper? Or put this as a warning on the menu. It feels in your teeth like your food has sand in it (you know, beach day sandwich), or that feeling when you eat eggs and there was shell in it. I was unable to eat this dish at all. I would have appreciated being offered something for this... because if I was AT the restaurant, I would have (embarassingly, because I hate doing this) sent it back. I struggled through a few bites, because that FLAVOR is SO GOOD, but the sand-in-my-teeth feeling made me have to stop.<br&gt;<br&gt;I will be reaching out to the restaurant to overtly ask for a refund or a free dish, as this wasn&amp;#39;t offered and I did have to then order a different meal from elsewhere because I couldn&amp;#39;t eat this dish.",11/17/2021,3
2551,A SINGLE PEBBLE ,Bank St,"chinese,noodles,restaurants,seafoo",4,3.5 ,"Not a single Asian customer when I visited. Not a single employee who spoke Chinese. Despite claims of this being an authentic Chinese restaurant and a website that says otherwise, the actual chef/owner is a white man who can&amp;#39;t cook Chinese food to save his life. He &amp;#34;visited&amp;#34; China multiple times so he feels that justifies charging double or triple regular prices for dishes like Mapo tofu. <br&gt;<br&gt;In elevated Chinese restaurants, that Mapo tofu might be made with lobster or foie gras. Here, you pay over $20 to prove how white you are. If you&amp;#39;ve never been to a Chinatown before, you might be impressed. <br&gt;<br&gt;Dishes like the overhyped mock eel are overly salty. <br&gt;<br&gt;Waitress here didn&amp;#39;t even know the difference between soy sauce and vinegar when I asked for the latter for my dumplings. <br&gt;<br&gt;I asked multiple times what ethnicity the chef was and where he was from with the waitress avoiding the answer again and again until finally confessing he was white. <br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a disqualifier, but in a town that&amp;#39;s 95% white, definitely looks and feels like cultural appropriation when you don&amp;#39;t hire any Asian servers or kitchen staff. <br&gt;<br&gt;The &amp;#34;tasting menu&amp;#34; that changes all the time by the way, never changes. <br&gt;<br&gt;If you really want authentic Chinese, Burlington has Hong&amp;#39;s Dumplings where the Chinese owner and her mother make the dumplings right in front of you because they don&amp;#39;t need to hide who they really are.<br&gt;<br&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a local or a tourist reading this, please support an actual Asian owned business instead of pretending to by putting money into the hands of a white man ripping off their culture badly.",4/1/2022,1

We had the Shahi Mutter Paneer, Curry Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Garlic Naan and Vegetable Samosas. We have been here a few times in the last 6 months and everything has been outstanding. <br&gt;Street parking is tough, but there is a UVM lot across the street that doesn&amp;#39;t require a permit after 6pm. <br&gt;Hot towels to clean your hands at the end of the meal was a nice touch.<br&gt;Only complaint- annoying pop music blaring from a TV, which we were directly under.

2571,MASALA ELAICHI ,Colchester Ave,"indpak,restaurant",ul,4.0 ,"I wish I had good things to say but this is yet another disappointing Indian restaurant in the Burlington area. I made sure to eat here on several occasions, spaced out over a year to give them an opportunity to improve. My first visit by the way was right when they opened. Beginner&amp;#39;s woes, they call it. Give them a chance to improve, they said. <br&gt;<br&gt;12 months later, I came back and ordered several dishes. Any change? Not a single bit. The food is just not authentic and borderline appalling. Take for example the lamb biryani. I&amp;#39;ve eaten biryani for 20+ years so I know what to expect. The biryani here is just rice sautéed in random spices and bell peppers with a few chunks of lamb thrown in. It has no semblance of a real biryani dish. The spices used in the dish were oddly chosen and didn&amp;#39;t even go well together, to the point where my tongue was asking &amp;#34;what the heck are you even eating?&amp;#34; <br&gt;<br&gt;Another example, the chicken tikka masala. This is supposed to be charbroiled (tandoor grilled) chicken tossed into a creamy tomato curry (hence the name chicken tikka - google it). Not only was the curry sauce subpar, the chicken they use are just pieces of dark meat thrown in. Pure complacency (or laziness, call it whatever you wish). They surely know these recipes are not authentic but there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be any incentive to deliver at a reasonable level (and definitely won&amp;#39;t be given all the rave reviews). I have more I could share but I&amp;#39;ll stop there. Very disappointed. Back to Trader Joe&amp;#39;s for Indian food it is.",5/14/2022,2
2572,MASALA ELAICHI ,Colchester Ave,"indpak,restaurant",ul,4.0 ,"Elaichi has potential. We went there on a Friday night in October, frankly because all restaurants in downtown Burlington were &amp;#34;fully committed&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fully engaged&amp;#34;. <br&gt;<br&gt;It is about a mile up Pearl from Church and parking is available across the street. <br&gt;<br&gt;The food was good but honestly the most memorable aspect of the evening were the Westminster chimes erupting from the outer and inner doors when any customer entered or exited. Volume dialed at around a 7, every second or third bite our delicious samosas or bangin bartha was punctuated by the 8-note chimes. <br&gt;<br&gt;DING ding ding ding....ding ding DING  ding. <br&gt;<br&gt;Aside from the chimes, the food was overall very very good. Veggie samosas hot and crispy, masala dosa likewise--tangy crepes rolled around coriander infused potato, bangin bartha spice forward eggplant puree. The only conspicuously bland dish was the chicken tikka masala. <br&gt;<br&gt;The interior cafateriorish. And, of course, the incessant chimes--they were unpleasant but made the evening so bizarrely memorable that I&amp;#39;m presently uncertain how to feel about them.

We just kept getting the &amp;#34;just a few minutes&amp;#34; from the owner ever time he passed by. My only observation was that the people who ordered after us were all locals so maybe that is the key here. <br&gt;<br&gt;During our wait, a couple that came and decided to leave after hearing about the wait time (45 minutes) but as soon as they were out the door they were heckled for reading about this place online and not being willing to make the wait for the best sandwich in Burlington.<br&gt;<br&gt;Sandwiches were good but honestly the long wait and customer heckling really ruined it for me.",10/16/2022,3

After coming here a few times, I have to assume the people leaving those reviews are themselves unpleasant people. If you are the kind of person who does not respect people who provide you a service, and who goes in to stores and restaurants with a bad attitude towards the workers, maybe a sense of entitlement or a lack of gratitude, then maybe he will respond accordingly. Personally, I have always felt very welcomed here. Ladislav&amp;#39;s intriguing, eccentric charm is half the reason I love this place.<br&gt;<br&gt;The other half is the sandwiches! The flavor combinations are definitely unexpected (miso, egg, and provolone cheese? what?!) but SO delicious. If you have allergies, strong food preferences, or just like to know exactly what&amp;#39;s in your sandwich, go online and look at the menu before ordering, because the ingredients are not listed on the board in the restaurant. I&amp;#39;ve never made any substitutions, but I have seen other customers do it without issue. The Lebanese Lamb, Japanese Miso, and Babylonian Beef are all delicious sandwiches, and I can&amp;#39;t wait to try some other combinations.<br&gt;<br&gt;Be warned that the sandwiches are a bit pricey - I believe the cheapest ones are around $10-$11, and the most expensive are around $25. Also be prepared for a longer wait than you might be used to for sandwiches. 20-25 minutes is not out of the question here. If you are in a hurry, this is the wrong place to go.

Oh, and the beers are wicked cheap, mostly $5 and under.  $4.50 for a Backseat Berner from Otter Creek is a steal. While they do attract a fairly raucous crowd, this is not the kind of bar where people come to get smashed on Coors Light and cheap well drinks while listening to blaring pop tunes.  Reggae and pool are the primary activities other than drinking.<br&gt;<br&gt;A few years back, they added a pizza window that has since expanded their menu offerings to more than just cheese and pepperoni.  While its not the best pizza in the world, its pretty good for a bar and certainly hits the spot after a beer or two.",11/26/2015,5

I went in not fully understanding how their system works, so I observed what other people were doing to get a beer. Not only was I yelled at and scolded by the male bartender, but the female bartender continued to ignore me and help others around me. After standing at the bar for a few minutes, she decided to then assist me when no one else was around. I handed her a dollar and she rudely rolled her eyes and stated that &amp;#34;everyone else was handing her two dollars instead of one&amp;#34; (which is probably the reason why she did not want to help me in the first place).<br&gt;<br&gt;It is a shame that an establishment keeps employees that act this way toward their consumers. If I were management, I wound not hesitate to find replacements, especially reading countless negative reviews about the same issue below.

They&amp;#39;ve got a weird airlock double-door thing going on which makes it awkward to casually stroll in while wielding photo gear, but I eventually made it. It was 7pm on a Saturday, and dead. Three others, a couple and one other solo gent, were in watching a soccer game, and not saying much. I&amp;#39;m assuming it gets busier later on in the night.

The best beer I had on the whole trip. My companion went with the Helles Boch, and enjoyed it... medium dark and malty sweet. After that she was feeling adventurous and got a (free!) flight of the four house beers. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that is standard, or if it was just quiet that evening, but free beer always tastes better.
