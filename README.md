This is a 6 week, 2 person data science project looking data from all the restaurants in Burlington, VT (all restaurants that had Yelp sites in March 2023).

For this project we collected data from restaurants by webscraping from Yelp, then used this data to identify trends in average ratings.
After this, we created a few classification models that predicted if a restaurant would have high or low customer satisfaction.

We presented our findings in two formats -- one was a paper and the other was a 10 minute presentation.
