0,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,"The Sushi is definitely quality however, wait times for the food are very long. The prices for the sushi is comparable with a NYC Omakase restaurant which is not okay. Good sushi does not mean that you can charge Omakase prices and this was definitely not Omakase. I spent around 250$ and was literally still hungry after eating. Despite the prices though the food was good.",2/18/2023,4
1,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,"This place was delicious. Service was great. The menu is pure, not a lot of fried this, mayo that. Absolutely delicious. So happy to have found it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Honestly, the 1 and 2 star reviews below are everything that&amp;#39;s wrong with Yelp. 1 star because you got a ticket for double parking when you came to pickup? Those reviews are thoughtless, selfish and worthless.<br&gt;<br&gt;This place is great if you&amp;#39;re looking for good sushi in Burlington. Will definitely be back!",8/31/2022,5
2,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,This place is legit. Fantastic Japanese food. Sure the service can sometimes be slow by American standards but that is not how sushi is meant to be.  And it is a testament to devotion to quality confounded by the lack of service industry workers. Quality takes time and love. Get some appetizers. Some sake and craft cocktails. Put away your phone and enjoy the food. <br&gt;<br&gt;Mike-san is an artist. Highly recommend the chef special sushi sampler. No soy sauce please. Would you deface the Mona Lisa with crayons? I think not.,7/20/2022,5

4,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,Food was slow to get to the table even though the place wasn&amp;#39;t busy. <br&gt;Everyone agreed the food was WAYYY too salty; felt like they stripped half an ocean&amp;#39;s worth of minerals onto our bowls/plates. Not worth the time or price.,9/27/2022,1
5,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,Amazing and fresh sushi. Service was excellent!  If you want real sushi with fresh fish then go here.,1/24/2023,5
6,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,"Was hoping for something special, but can&amp;#39;t say I found it.<br&gt;Space is huge and spare with less than 1/4 containing tables.  No big deal, but odd.<br&gt;Miso soup:  for me it wasn&amp;#39;t hot enough, (temperature.)  My wife thought it was OK.<br&gt;Seaweed and burdock salads:  very tasty but pretty standard fare.  <br&gt;Sushi:  Rice is KEY to sushi, and in this case it felt like some unfortunate necessity.  i ordered the chef&amp;#39;s choice assortment.  The fish was huge relative to rice.  Some might appreciate this.  They should order sashimi.  The bites were too big and not balanced.    Hard to tell for sure, because fish was so dominant, but i thought rice could have been seasoned more.<br&gt;Owners of this place had Sansai restaurant years back where they offered really excellent and uncommon sushi - hamachi with plum paste and mint for instance - really good.  Was hoping something like this would appear in my assortment.  It didn&amp;#39;t.  Fish all tasted fresh.  Nothing was terrible but nothing was great.  Best piece was mackerel.<br&gt;Waitress was nice, and thankful the obnoxious bartender was absent.  Yes, I know who others have referred to.<br&gt;I hope it gets better, but not holding my breath.",1/20/2023,3
7,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,We have been twice and enjoyed our meals both times. The seaweed salad is a nice appetizer. The fish for the sushi is the freshest in Burlington. I had the Chef&amp;#39;s Sushi Assortment both times. Friends we are with really liked the Don Buri.  The waiters were so pleasant and helpful. <br&gt;<br&gt;We also had mochi for dessert and the black sesame was delicious. So glad to have them just off Church Street.,12/27/2021,5
8,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,"I was in town to go to Nectars and found this new sushi place with good reviews. We get there and the waitstaff didn&amp;#39;t want to give us a menu and told us the food wouldn&amp;#39;t come any quicker.  The young lady who helped us really tried to provide good service. The food was fresh but it took forever to get to us and the presentation was lacking. I wish this restaurant luck, they are trying and need to do better.",2/13/2022,2
9,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,Staff was very helpful in Recommending dishes and they created a great dining experience. The bartender was phenomenal and a great communicator he made the experience a five stars night. The sushi was fresh and flavorful. It was a place that I would go back to and recommend to anyone.,1/23/2022,5
10,SUSHI MAEDA ,"Cherry St, Bur","japanese,restaurants,sush",ul,3.5 ,"To be fair, the food was okay. The experience? not so much. I called and ordered dinner for my family right before I left Williston. Over $130 worth of food for me and kids. I was quoted 30 minutes lead time. When I arrived 30 minutes later on the dot, the order was not ready. Sure not a big deal, right? Well, it actually took over another hour to get my order! I was pretty close to cancelling it a few times. But kids had their hopes up for sushi. So I sucked it up and waited. When I got home, a lot of the items I ordered were missing from the bag. Ugh! I called the restaurant and they confirmed that the order was not complete, and that they had tried to call me back. To their credit my phone does have a record of that incoming call when I was driving. So I went back to get the rest of the food. Had to double park on Cherry Street this time. To my shock, the food was not ready! I tried to keep an eye on my car, but it got ticketed while I waited for a good 15 minutes. Granted it was my fault to double park. When I complained to Nick the manager, he agreed to pay for the ticket. To be honest, if he didn&amp;#39;t agree, I would have returned the food. Fast forward to 2 months later, I received a notification of the unpaid parking ticket in the mail, along with a fine on top of the original amount. I called the restaurant and spoke to Nick. He remembered the incident right away, however he insisted that the restaurant could not be responsible for my double parking. You would think Nick could have at least called me to let me know that before I incurred the fine. I don&amp;#39;t need to eat there ever again. Terrible service and manager&amp;#39;s words and integrity are worth less than $88.",8/11/2022,1
11,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"Pricey hotel food, but no major complaints. We had a nice breakfast buffet ($22) on Thanksgiving morning. We probably would have gone somewhere else but weren&amp;#39;t sure what else would be open.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall reliable but pricey spot to get some food.",11/24/2016,3
12,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"I&amp;#39;ve never felt so strongly that I wish I could give zero stars.<br&gt;<br&gt;Where do I start? I specifically asked the server (who had to be tracked down) whether an advertised promotion was available and was told that he would check. He never answered and then overcharged us terribly.<br&gt;<br&gt;Our food was inedible. When I explained that the chicken seemed undercooked the server argued, &amp;#34;that&amp;#39;s how it comes.&amp;#34;<br&gt;<br&gt;I am still trying to get a refund, two weeks later, because 1) no one can be reached and 2) when I&amp;#39;ve actually managed to get ahold of someone, they&amp;#39;ve blatantly lied and said that they called and / or emailed me! <br&gt;<br&gt;Unbelievable!",2/18/2022,1
13,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"This had to be one of the worst breakfast experiences I have ever had! <br&gt;<br&gt;This restaurant is inside the Hilton Burlington.  For breakfast you could choose the buffet for $18 which included made to order omelets or any eggs and pancakes. Or you could get a la carte and it would be the same price so we opted for the buffet. <br&gt;<br&gt;First, the service is horrendous!  Servers everywhere but no service. Made to order omelets took 45 minutes to come out of the kitchen and they all came out at different times. The buffet was cleared out and we were there at 8 am!  Nothing was restocked and what was left were rubbery scrambled eggs and cold potatoes and a couple hunks of cheese. When we inquires when the buffet would be restocked we were ignored. <br&gt;<br&gt;Seriously not worth the money!",7/2/2017,1
14,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"Convenient because I was staying in the hotel, but wouldn&amp;#39;t go to the restaurant unless staying in the hotel. It did its job and fed me good food, but it is overpriced (as to be expected from a hotel restaurant). Had a nice waiter but the food came out pretty slowly for being the only table dining.",5/26/2017,3
15,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"This is a hotel restaurant, so the bar is pretty low. My husband and I got burgers which were passable. My kids ordered mac and cheese from the kids menu. I realize that many low end restaurants serve Mac and cheese from a box- but could they at least get one with a pasta shape that doesn&amp;#39;t scream &amp;#34;Kraft&amp;#34;? I suppose our meal was as expected, but the service was especially slow. There was only a bartender, no waitstaff, despite about a half dozen people at the bar and another dozen on the patio.",6/25/2018,2
16,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,Maybe this place is better than this on a regular basis but tonight it was not good. All I ordered was wings and a dessert and it took 30 mins to get and people who got seated after us got their meal 10 mins before us. When we were finished I could not find the server to pay for 20 mins. Maybe next time I will sit at the bar and see if the service any different. Food was decent and wings had a good kick but the service ruined it for me.,4/1/2016,1
17,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"The prices are a bit high for their American cuisine. The Poutine was great, my burger was pretty good too. My boyfriend&amp;#39;s beef tenderloin dinner wasn&amp;#39;t worth the $38. The service was decent. This was a convenient option since we were staying in the hotel and didn&amp;#39;t know where to eat that night. The room service for the hotel is the same menu as the mounted cat, but more expensive.",11/12/2016,3
18,THE MOUNTED CAT ,"Battery St, Bur","desserts,food,lounges,newamerican,nightlife,restaurant",2,2.5 ,"This place is awesome! You have to try the hanger steak skewers, the sliders and pulled pork from the bar menu. Also loved the strawberry basil smash cocktail - and of course it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that they carry Heady Topper and Focal Banger (both not on the menu).

It is sort of like a scene out of Portlandia. Victorian painted interior, moody waitstaff, and minimalist co-op atmosphere. <br&gt;<br&gt;They seem to have a large breakfast menu with hipster ingredients like kale. <br&gt;<br&gt;We ordered an oatmeal cookie and a chocolate covered donut. The cookie was ok. The donut tasted like vegetable oil and the texture of the donut was chewy. I don&amp;#39;t know if it was gluten free or what. Not good.

I was holding my laptop and another employee turned to me as said that I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to set up my laptop on the weekends. Oh, AND there were no jelly-filled donuts.

When there&amp;#39;s a wait everywhere downtown for eggs, Nunyuns (being counter service, self seating, and in the Old North End) is almost always a better, quicker alternative. You pay at the counter, so if you&amp;#39;re splitting up the check, its easy to do (beware, though, its cash or check only- they are happy to take checks from my experience). <br&gt;The buttermilk biscuit on the egg sandwich is delicious, eat one. They are willing to work with dietary restrictions you may have to help you find a meal (or as people with dietary restrictions are familiar with, SOMETHING to eat). Past 11 or 11:30 AM, they stop cooking breakfast aside from the egg sandwich and move to lunch. Their coffee is good and the baked goods (made in-house) are great! (Try the doughnuts if they have them). Great place to sit outside and read or get an iced coffee in the summer. <br&gt;<br&gt;The walls consistently have different art hung up and its fun to go and look at what&amp;#39;s on display. Nice variety of house plants too, huge false cactus. <br&gt;<br&gt;All that being said, the staff can be moody sometimes (don&amp;#39;t worry, your food will still come out great, they don&amp;#39;t really mean it).

Nice touch that you get free chips and salsa when sitting down. I ordered the chimichanga which was good but fairly different. It came smothered in cheese sauce, which was good but a bit overwhelming and made the changa soggy. Also ordered a frozen marg which was terrible. More like a snow cone with very little liquid.

Our server then promptly forgot about us in increments of 30 minutes until he felt like asking us if we were interested in drinks and food, and the occasional but far too sparse and never-fulfilled offer of a water refill. The food was average and most definitely overcooked, but the real let down was the service. Not only was the table neglected, but when the server did communicate with my friends and I, there was no element of kindness, humor or hospitality.

Really, I could not have made the dish any more boring. Saying that I was disappointed is an understatement. It is almost comical because the dish is so straightforward but this restaurant managed to absolutely get it completely wrong.<br&gt;<br&gt;Moving on to the tacos, I payed extra for guacamole in each of them, and both were delivered with NO guacamole.

The owner&amp;#39;s social media feed hypes the food quality, and the prices are also very high - so, tbh I was expecting closer to perfection on the flavor front. <br&gt;<br&gt;The pace was also off for dine in service - with loooong waits between the 3 main dish items that we ordered. Not fun. It&amp;#39;s BYOB - so bring a lot and prepare to wait. <br&gt;<br&gt;The other issue is the vibe. The room is pleasant but the music - while good - was ridiculously loud.

Thirdly, their pretentious rude and snub attitude doesn&amp;#39;t match the landscape of Burlington or Vermont for that matter. Why anyone would become a regular customer here is beyond my level of comprehension. Oh, btw it seems like they write their own reviews for damage control after receiving a painfully truthful review.

As we waited outside for our food, two other customers came outside muttering and cursing the abrupt change in ambiance and the clear indifference the owner and her 2 counterparts had towards anyone and everyone there.

Then the owner has the nerve to complain on instagram that people should tip 20% on take out and blocked people that disagreed with him, speaks volumes of what the owner thinks of his customers and is extremely unprofessional. You make it difficult to want to tip 20% when you think serving uncut, and inconsistently cooked pizza is satisfactory.

Every week they bring fresh vegetables from Boston and New Jersey. The fruits and vegetables are fresh almost always. They have a variety of vegetables and it includes many exotic vegetables which are not commonly available in other stores. This store thrives just because of the variety and freshness. I&amp;#39;m here every two weeks and the staff are very accommodating to get stuff from Boston on demand. <br&gt;I have had the food only once and the food is as good as their veggies.

At first we thought that it was only an Asian market, and doubted whether we should stay after we saw the small, unremarkable dining area. We are very happy that we changed our minds. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, curried chicken and lamb kebabs. The portions and prices were very good. All the dishes were very tasty. The lamb kebabs were outstanding. The advantage of being located in a market is that the chef cooks the dishes with fresh ingredients that are being sold in the market. As an added bonus, we checked in to this restaurant on Yelp and got a free cup of delicious, hot chai. We will definitely eat here again when we visit Burlington again and we highly recommend it.",5/22/2016,4

The fish was next some naan. I feel like a lot of cross contamination is possible. And new stock around the store blocks those fridges. Looking at the dining area I wouldn&amp;#39;t even give this place a chance to dine at - looking at another review they mentioned the tables and silverware were filthy - this is why I wouldn&amp;#39;t eat there. I may stop in here for an item or two but I don&amp;#39;t trust it. It was a decently busy store so other locals must like it.,1/23/2018,1

I can never decide between chicken or veggie so my gracious server brings an order of half and half.  The Chole Bhatura (chickpea) appetizer with bread (I go with Puri) is plenty for a lunch.  Any of the Thali&amp;#39;s are ample to share.  Butter or Massala chicken are also my favorites with enough to bring home.  Sometimes a bite or two of the fish plates have bones yet I can overlook this as the flavored are so rich and aromatic.  A monthly delight for me!,3/25/2016,5

The store definitely felt like it had more Indian products in comparison to other ethnic goods and definitely has a small, Asian grocery feel to it.  The market has 3 narrow corridors packed with various and elective dry, frozen, and fresh goods. Mixed in with home goods (mainly cookware) and food were sneakers and flip flops as well as some other clothing material.  The market definitely has potential but because of the slightly chaotic flow and seemingly random organization I would be more likely to recommend other options in the Burlington/Winooski area.",10/5/2014,3

There might be a small language problem, we clearly stated we needed the least spicy, our server assured us you could get it any way you wanted. The food was brought out by a sullen lady and the cook was behind her wanting to make sure the food was good, he was smiling. Is it de regior for Indian servers in Indian restaurant to act as if they are mad you came in?<br&gt;On the other the young lady at the cash register was fluent in English and so friendly. I which she had taken our order. We ordered the Kabob and a mixed grill, and our daughter likes to try vegan and vegiterian dishes. If you think kabob is what you get in a Middle Eastern place, not so with this place. Kabob is something like the ground meat or chicken kabobs not long and skewered but more like balls and yes very spicy, the spice inbedded in the ground meat. Our daughter had a vegan Nepalies meatball which was delicious however the sauce it was in was way too hot. The mixed grill and I am not sure what we got becuae after the wait person saying they didn&amp;#39;t have the cook came along and said what was in front of my husband was the mixed grill. Again it was smothered in vegetables stewed with hot chili peppers. <br&gt;The basmati rice was very good. The eatery part is clean and cheerful, they would do well to bring a pitcher of ice water to the table instead of a pitcher of warm water that was sitting on the table.  When we asked for ice we were met with a puzzled look, it was 90 degrees in Burlington last week.  <br&gt;<br&gt;I will go back to check out the groceries, by the time we were ready to leave there was so much confusion as to what we had, that I didn&amp;#39;t want to muddle it with groceries.",8/23/2015,3

The saag paneer was phenomenal, and quite different from your average saag paneer. The spinach was super fresh, cut into slices, and far from overcooked. The spices were complex and it tasted creamy although it didn&amp;#39;t have any dairy in it.  Papadum sauce was amazing (papadums and naan were on the house).

It seems ridiculous that this place hasn&amp;#39;t garnered at least a micro following on Yelp. Well, here I go!!<br&gt;<br&gt;First thing to know: this place is a sandwich shop by day, cocktail lounge by night. Second thing to know: make sure you REALLY love meat. <br&gt;<br&gt;The deli:  I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what to say...but I will anyway! First off, they offer about 12 regular sandwiches, half of them hot and half of them cold. They also have specials and make your owns. Keep in mind that all sandwiches can be hot (or cold I&amp;#39;m guessing!). One thing is that most sandwiches have minimal veg ingredients but it&amp;#39;s definitely worth it.<br&gt;<br&gt;Staff-wise, all the guys (and yes they were all men when I visited) were really nice and helpful. Definitely ask their thoughts if you can&amp;#39;t decide!!<br&gt;<br&gt;On my visit, I ordered their spin on a Cuban and...daaang! The sandwich weighed AT LEAST 2 lbs!!! What&amp;#39;s more, it was mostly meat! This is the first sandwich that I have enjoyed an appropriate bread to meat ratio. I mean this thing was severely pregnant with meat! Whew! Honestly, I probably could have saved half of it for lunch but it was so good that I ate all of it. <br&gt;<br&gt;In a separate visit, the cocktail lounge was very posh in an old school speakeasy jazz club type of way. All of the menus are glued to actual books (is that legal??) and they have a great cocktail list. Their chocolate cake is excellent as well! The room is divided into a music room and the bar area. You can still see the music but it was nice to be divided if you wanted to talk vs listen to music.<br&gt;<br&gt;Overall: the sandwich will hold you over for a week (or at least the day!) and the cocktails are great!",10/1/2018,4

I liked that they shaped the buns differently, so it&amp;#39;s easy to tell them apart. <br&gt;<br&gt;The oval one was the veggie. It had clear vermicelli noodles, mushrooms, onions, not sure what else, as I ate it too quickly. :) the flavors were pretty good. <br&gt;<br&gt;The round one was the meat. It was a clump of meat inside, not loose ground meat, but this isn&amp;#39;t a bad thing. The flavor was really good. <br&gt;<br&gt;The dough had a great consistency, comparing well to many NYC Chinese bakeries that make buns. Slight chewiness, and the slightest touch of sweetness, if you&amp;#39;re looking for it. <br&gt;<br&gt;I would totally have these again. It&amp;#39;s street food, easy to eat while walking.

Brio had some of the best coffee I&amp;#39;ve had in a while. Went with my girlfriend so I was luckily able to try both the drip coffee and a macchiato. Drip coffee comes in 8oz or 12oz, which is not what I&amp;#39;m used to, but sometimes 8oz is all I want, so that&amp;#39;s kind of nice that they have that option. It&amp;#39;s slightly pricey for that size though, like $2 vs $3 for those sizes. The macchiato was fantastic. Espresso was bright, slightly chocolate, the milk texture was perfect. Both drinks were so good, I decided to buy a bag of beans to bring home with me, which I have been using for my daily pourover. <br&gt;<br&gt;Side note: they have a sign at the register that states they don&amp;#39;t accept tips because their drink prices reflect higher wages that they&amp;#39;re paying their employees, which I thought was really nice.

(Except the vegetarian shepherds pie, but maybe it&amp;#39;s just that I&amp;#39;m not a lentils kind of girl.)<br&gt;<br&gt;It&amp;#39;s criminal how cheap the Caesar salad is for how good it is.  The soups are solid.  The salad bar is fresh and cheaper than you get the veggies at a store.  Can&amp;#39;t go wrong with the egg salad.<br&gt;<br&gt;And the staff here can be the best part of your long night waiting for that baby/test result/fever to pass.  If you are lucky, the night cook will be Brandon, who offers free entertainment.  But I warn you: he is a gifted salesman, and you may land up buying more than you planned.  You won&amp;#39;t regret it, but you may land up wondering how you went from just a grilled cheese to basically buying two dinners, a desert, and a side of beets. For just you.  I swear, he must work on commission...<br&gt;<br&gt;I&amp;#39;d write more, but that Shepard&amp;#39;s pie isn&amp;#39;t gonna eat itself, and I don&amp;#39;t care for beets as much when they are cold...",9/11/2018,5

The ingredients are local and oh did I mention this place was cheap? A whole small thin crust pizza is only $3! Half of it is $1.50! I could easily have a meal for $5 including drinks. I love the hours here because it&amp;#39;s open pretty much all the time. Doing work here is great too during non-meal hours and weekends. Free wifi! They do rotate some dishes.

For example, sometimes Monday is currently falafel salad, but it also could be taco salad!). I typically prefer M/W menu, and would rather skip T/H/F but, it&amp;#39;s as cheap if not cheaper than what I could bring from home. Those days I can go for a staple of the cafe such as salad, black bean burger, or chicken sandwich though.<br&gt;The food here is cheap. Really cheap. It&amp;#39;s much better quality than fast food, but the price is about the same. The salad bar is constantly stocked and fresh. <br&gt;It&amp;#39;s pretty clean too, though the condiment bar past the registers can get messy. Napkins and cutlery are restocked often. <br&gt;<br&gt;Coffee here is pretty bad. Worse than your average gas station but better than the crap my co-workers make.

They have the best soups (which can also be found at the Green Mountain coffee cart kiosk) for $1.50-3.00. The grill and pizza station has burgers and pizza for only $3.00. The cafe also removes the temptation of bad greasy foods like fries and onion rings. Instead, they are replaced by chicken breast burgers, bison or Highland organic beef, and thin whole wheat pizzas. Did I also mention that the burgers are topped off with generous portions of grilled mushrooms, onions, bell peppers in addition to the usual cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes for only $3.00? My guilty pleasure at this place is actually a magic bar for dessert. It&amp;#39;s their version of a seven layer bar with coconut and walnut. If you love the Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;#39;s ice cream flavor, you will love their version of the bar. Hopefully it has less fat and is made from whole wheat or something (although it doesn&amp;#39;t taste like it). It can be had for a mere 65 cents.

The food is good, but a little more pricey than the rest of the hospital. You do pay for the nice atmosphere and service. They give you a pad to put on your table and serve you your dishes as well as clean up when you&amp;#39;re done. The place feels like a little bit of quiet heaven in the hospital.

RJ&amp;#39;s is a sports-bar that turns night-club in it&amp;#39;s later hours.  I can&amp;#39;t speak to it&amp;#39;s late night performance, but the sports-bar side is certainly my element.  <br&gt;<br&gt;This has been my go-to game day destination since 2009.  Jay the owner is super friendly and really cares about his business and pleasing his customers.  The staff is pretty chill and has a good amount of patience to deal with a bunch of rambunctious sports fans (myself included).  They have on many occasions, gone out of their way to make us happy.  <br&gt;<br&gt;Here a few reasons why RJ&amp;#39;s should be your game day choice:<br&gt;<br&gt;No 1:  If you are a Green Bay Packers fan there is usually a good sized group of us there, so please join us!  Also, a more than generous display of Bills fandom can be caught here on any given Sunday.<br&gt;<br&gt;No 2:  Drink specials.  While they don&amp;#39;t boast the best draught list in town, it fits the day of drinking bill and that paired with, build your own bloodies and mimosas (Sundays) is the perfect recipe for game day.  The prices are always good and they usually have an entire list for the game day cocktail drinkers.<br&gt;<br&gt;No 3:  TONS of tv&amp;#39;s.  Normally not my thing, but when it comes to catching my game and keeping tabs on my fantasy team, it quickly becomes my thing.  They have plenty of tv&amp;#39;s and usually have nearly every game on.  The only caveat here is that sometimes locating a seat by the tv with your game on can be a challenge; in other words, get there early.<br&gt;<br&gt;No. 4: Wings!  I love the dry rub, but they have an array of choices and you can mix it up.  The burgers are also good and they do a decent brunch, check it out.  Having good food options during game time is a MUST for me. <br&gt;<br&gt;No 5: The staff.  Friendly, attentive and efficient.  They keep the beers coming and manage to do so with a smile.  They juggle the ever-so-complicated split checks and get you out when you need out.  Props to these ladies, always working so hard and doing a fab job.<br&gt;<br&gt;That&amp;#39;s the game day gist.  If you are looking for a place to catch a game this is BY FAR the best place in town.  Forget Buffalo Wild Wings and go local.  Jay is a great guy and he deserves your business!

She didn&amp;#39;t know how to make a mind eraser shot so instead of asking us or the other bartenders she got mad when we said it wasn&amp;#39;t correct. Needless to say we never got the shot. We asked for a manager and there was no manager on duty. Phyllis said I&amp;#39;m sorry but night shift works differently and probably makes different shots. She then sat there on her laptop at the bar. Later she dropped off our bill and said &amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m leaving so you need to cash out.&amp;#34; Nothing was comped. A few minutes later the bouncer arrived and came over to our table, carded us then said we needed to leave. Would&amp;#39;ve been a good idea to card us before we got served. We caused no scene and paid our bill. It&amp;#39;s a shame because my friend goes there all the time and is friends with some of the workers. Also asked to pay music and we were told no.

They regularly let in underage people and I have multiple friends who have been roofied there. They never have enough staff on Saturday nights and they will reuse dirty glasses without washing them. They will also make people wait in line outside when it&amp;#39;s not full inside yet. You wait 20 minutes then go inside and there&amp;#39;s maybe 15 people in there.

The overall place was very clean and fresh looking, with a fun layout and numerous seating options to both relax or get some work done. <br&gt;<br&gt;The overall vibe of the place was interesting - my initial reaction was that it seemed like they combined the Apple Store and Abercrombie, but then decided to make it a coffee place.  The music lightened up a bit a moment later, but the image stayed stuck in my head regardless.  I&amp;#39;m still not sure if that&amp;#39;s good or bad, but it seemed like a good place where you could somehow both relax and be productive.",10/1/2021,5

The space is also huge with loads of indoor and outdoor seating currently available. I stopped in around 11:15 on a Friday and there was only a short line that moved quickly. Their menu includes a sizable offering of coffee, espresso, and tea drinks. I went for their pour over, especially because they roast their own beans, which was very reasonably priced at $3.50 and required only a 5 min wait. They offered three different roasts and I went with the light - it was some of the best I&amp;#39;ve had! With notes of peach and cinnamon, it was deliciously well balanced and clearly a well made pour over. To top it off, the service was excellent and everyone was super sweet. They do also have a small setup selling beans and other common coffee supplies.

The bread was nice and crispy and the meat was perfect. My only quam is that they put too much dressing on it, by the time I picked up my second half the bread was very, very soggy. Made it difficult to hold and no one likes eating soggy bread. So I ate most of the sandwich before I resorted to just eating the meat straight with no bread.

The only thing that stung was the price: a whopping $3.13/slice. Now, a small pie was $10.99 which is far more reasonable, but it IS close to Church Street and it IS open 24 hours, so I guess supply and demand plus location (location, location) comes into play (ah, capitalism). <br&gt;<br&gt;I found the menu in general to be normally priced, so I think I&amp;#39;d get food here again (they even deliver), but not just by the slice.",12/13/2017,4

I want to take some responsibility for being inattentive to their pricing somehow but even so...who charges that much for a dirty chai???

The waitress wasn&amp;#39;t all that friendly or attentive. They have a decent beer selection and frequent live music, so they have that going for them... but my god, their food is awful.",1/7/2018,1
437,NECTAR’S ,"Main St, Bur","burgers,chicken_wings,comfortfood,restaurant",2,3.0 ,Terrible service on a Friday at 6:30 for their fried chicken. It&amp;#39;s $14.50 for two pieces of chicken some dry macaroni and a small serving of collard greens.  Not worth it.,8/7/2015,1
438,NECTAR’S ,"Main St, Bur","burgers,chicken_wings,comfortfood,restaurant",2,3.0 ,"Nectar&amp;#39;s is definitely overrated. <br&gt;<br&gt;Why did I not listen to my trendy little airport shuttle driver who told me all of the fun/cool things to do in Vermont. He specifically said, &amp;#34;Don&amp;#39;t believe the hype and go to Nectar&amp;#39;s. You WILL regret it&amp;#34;.<br&gt; <br&gt;To the people in my group, &amp;#34;Oh, it will be fine&amp;#34;, I said.....famous last words.<br&gt;<br&gt;After dinner, a group of us strolled in. After all, you always hear about Nectar&amp;#39;s being the place Phish sort of got their start. Well, I guess if you want to go inside and get that vibe of being where they got started, be my guest. It is definitely not my cup of tea and I really wish I would have listened to my trendy shuttle driver.<br&gt;<br&gt;The place was dark, sticky floors, flies everywhere; drinks served in plastic cups for WAY too much money! The staff seemed as unhappy to be there as we were. I kept reading that they were the only place where there was live music. Totally untrue! There are 4-5 places on Church Street that had live music and were much more enjoyable than Nectar&amp;#39;s. <br&gt; <br&gt;When we walked out after one drink, the folks in my group said, &amp;#34;Thanks a lot, Shannon. Oh it will be fine, she says!!! Last time we listen to Shannon on a place to go&amp;#34;. Luckily, I made up for it by taking them to the other places my trendy little shuttle driver suggested. Thank you trendy little shuttle driver, thank you.",8/13/2012,1

440,NECTAR’S ,"Main St, Bur","burgers,chicken_wings,comfortfood,restaurant",2,3.0 ,"Went on a Thursday night. Turns out it&amp;#39;s trivia night, but we were just popping in for a burger and drink before a show at The Flynn nearby since trivia wasn&amp;#39;t starting for about 30 mins. Sat ourselves and watched the waitstaff walk by repeatedly for 10 minutes without a single person approaching us, yet we could see them attending other tables. <br&gt;<br&gt;Ultimately, we grabbed our stuff and left since there are easily a dozen options nearby. It wasn&amp;#39;t busy and there were ample staff, but I guess they weren&amp;#39;t interested in two more customers. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",2/27/2015,1
